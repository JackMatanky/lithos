### Mathematical Induction
1. **Base Case**:
	- Verify the statement is true for the initial value, usually $n = 1$.
2. **Inductive Hypothesis**:
	- Assume that the statement is true for some arbitrary positive integer $k,$ such that $n = k$.
3. **Inductive Step**:
	- Prove that the statement is true for $n = k + 1$ based on the assumption that it is true for $n = k$.
