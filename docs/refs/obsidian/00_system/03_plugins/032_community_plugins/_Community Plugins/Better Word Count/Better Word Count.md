# Better Word Count

![GitHub Workflow Status](https://img.shields.io/github/workflow/status/lukeleppan/better-word-count/Build%20Release?logo=github&style=for-the-badge)![GitHub release (latest by date)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/lukeleppan/better-word-count?style=for-the-badge)![Obsidian Downloads](https://img.shields.io/badge/dynamic/json?logo=obsidian&color=%23483699&label=downloads&query=%24%5B%22better-word-count%22%5D.downloads&url=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2Fobsidianmd%2Fobsidian-releases%2Fmaster%2Fcommunity-plugin-stats.json&style=for-the-badge)

**IMPORTANT NOTICE:** Due to the introduction of the new Live Preview feature, this plugin needed to be almost entirely rewritten. It will be unstable for a while so please report bugs on github.

This plugin is the same as the built-in **Word Count** plugin, except when you select text, it will count the selected word instead of the whole document. I recommend turning off the built-in **Word Count** because this plugin is designed to replace that. This plugin also has the ability to store statistics about your vault.
