# Deck Formatting

Anywhere within the file, format the deck that you want the notes to go into as follows:

```
{Target Deck Line}
{Deck name}
```

Or as:

```
{Target Deck Line}: {Deck name}
```

For example, with the default settings:

```
TARGET DECK
Mathematics
```

Or:

```
TARGET DECK: Mathematics
```

You may place more than one target deck in the same file, but only the first instance will be read and used.

## Obsidian Plugin only

See [[Folder Settings]] for how to do this on a folder-level
