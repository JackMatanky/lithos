# Steps for New Users

If you are a **new user**, these steps are recommended:

1. Check [[02 Setup|Setup]] for instructions to install the script.
2. Check [[03 Regex|Regex]] to see if there is a template that works for you.
3. Then, check the information on the following topics:
    - "[[04 Config|Config]]"
    - "[[09 Note Formatting|Note Formatting]]"
    - "[[10 Field Formatting|Field Formatting]]"
    - "[[08 Deck Formatting|Deck Formatting]]"
    - "[[13 Markdown Formatting|Markdown Formatting]]"
    - "[[15 Image Formatting|Image Formatting]]"
    - "[[06 Deleting Notes|Deleting Notes]]"
    - "[[11 Tag Formatting|Tag Formatting]]"
    - "[[12 Cloze Formatting|Cloze Formatting]]"
    - "[[05 Usage|Usage]]"
    - "[[07 Updating Existing Notes|Updating Existing Notes]]"
    - "[[19 Data File|Data File]]"
4. You should be good to go simply running the script/plugin with the '[[03 Regex|Regex]]' option checked.

Note that it is highly recommended to use the Obsidian plugin if the user wants to use Obsidian_to_Anki with Obsidian.
