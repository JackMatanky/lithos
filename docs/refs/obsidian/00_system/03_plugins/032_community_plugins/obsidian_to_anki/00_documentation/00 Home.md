- **[[11 Tag Formatting|Tag Formatting]]**, on a *per-note* and *per-file* basis. And for Obsidian plugin users, on a *per-folder* basis too!
- **[[08 Deck Formatting|Deck Formatting]]** on a *per-file* basis. And for Obsidian plugin users, on a *per-folder* basis too!
- **[[13 Markdown Formatting|Markdown Formatting]]**.

- **[[16 Audio Formatting|Audio Formatting]]**
- **[[06 Deleting Notes|Deleting Notes]] from the file**.
- **Reading from all files in a directory automatically** - recursively too!
- **[[Inline Notes]]** - Shorter syntax for typing out notes on a single line.
- **[[12 Cloze Formatting|Cloze Formatting]]** - A more compact syntax to do Cloze text.
- **[[Frozen Fields]]**
- **Skipping over previously scanned and unchanged files** - should be useful for large vaults! See [[19 Data File|Data File]].
- **[[Obsidian Integration]]**
- **[[03 Regex|Regex]]** - Using **regular expressions**, add custom syntax to generate **notes that make sense for you.**. Note that **all custom syntax is off by default**, and must be programmed into the script via the config file - see [[03 Regex|Regex]] for instructions.

By default, the script adds to the current profile in Anki - you need to switch profiles in Anki to add to another profile.
