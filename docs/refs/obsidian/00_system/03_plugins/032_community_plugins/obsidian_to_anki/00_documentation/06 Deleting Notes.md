# Deleting Notes

To delete a note, format as following:

```
{Delete Note Line}
{Identifier}
```

For example, for a note with identifier "123456789", and default settings:

```

```

Ensure that you separate this DELETE block from any other note blocks with a newline/newlines - otherwise, this might be interpreted as simply adding the text "DELETE" to a note in Anki!
