```

Gets the folder that new files should be saved to, given the user's preferences.

### renameFile

renameFile(file: TAbstractFile, newPath: string): Promise<void>;
```

Rename or move a file safely, and update all links to it depending on the user's preferences.

### generateMarkdownLink

generateMarkdownLink(file: TFile, sourcePath: string, subpath?: string, alias?: string): string;
