# Diagrams

Obsidian uses [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/) to render diagrams and charts. Mermaid also provides [a helpful live editor](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid-live-editor).  
Mermaid provides the following diagram types:

- Flowchart
- Sequence diagram
- Class Diagram
- State Diagram
- Entity Relationship Diagram
- User Journey
- Gantt
- Pie Chart
- Requirement Diagram

```
```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    Alice->>+John: Hello John, how are you?
    Alice->>+John: John, can you hear me?
    John-->>-Alice: Hi Alice, I can hear you!
    John-->>-Alice: I feel great!
```

```
```mermaid 
graph TD 

Biology --> Chemistry ```
```

```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry
```

Obsidian supports linking to notes in Mermaid, these links won't show up on [Graph view](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Graph+view).

````
```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry

class Biology,Chemistry internal-link;
```
````

```mermaid
graph TD

Biology --> Chemistry

class Biology,Chemistry internal-link;
```

An easier w  
ay to do it is the following:

```
```mermaid
graph TD

A[Biology]
B[Chemistry]

A --> B

class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
```

```mermaid
graph TD

A[Biology]
B[Chemistry]

A --> B

class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
```

```mermaid
graph TD

A[Biology]
B[Chemistry]

A --> B

class A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J,K,L,M,N,O,P,Q,R,S,T,U,V,W,X,Y,Z internal-link;
```

This way, all the note names (at least until `Z[note name]`) are all automatically assigned the class `internal-link` when you use this snippet.

If you use special characters in your note names, you need to put the note name in double quotes.  
`"⨳ special character"`  
It looks like this if you follow the [second option](https://help.obsidian.md/How+to/Format+your+notes#^376b9d):  
`A["⨳ special character"]`
