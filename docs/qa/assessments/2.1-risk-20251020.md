# Risk Profile: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-10-20
Reviewer: Quinn

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 95/100 (minimal risk)
- Overall Assessment: Low risk implementation with good safeguards

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 1 risk
- Operational: 1 risk

### By Component

- Configuration Loading: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Configuration Loading Failure

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Viper is mature library with good error handling
**Impact**: Medium - Could prevent application startup
**Description**: If viper fails to load configuration or YAML is malformed, application won't start
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive error handling in adapter, validation at startup, clear error messages
**Status**: Mitigated - Error handling implemented and tested

### OPS-001: Invalid Vault Path Configuration

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Validation happens at startup
**Impact**: Medium - Application fails to start with invalid vault
**Description**: If vault path doesn't exist or isn't readable, application won't start
**Mitigation**: Vault path validation at startup with clear error messages, fails fast
**Status**: Mitigated - Validation implemented and tested

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None - no critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None - no high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Configuration loading error scenarios
- Invalid vault path handling
- YAML parsing failures
- Environment variable precedence

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Configuration loading failures (mitigated by validation)
- Invalid vault paths (mitigated by startup checks)

### Accepted Risks

None - all risks are acceptably low

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring:

- Application startup logs for configuration errors
- Configuration validation success metrics
- No specific alerts needed for this low-risk feature

## Risk Review Triggers

Review risk profile if:

- Viper library updated to new major version
- Configuration requirements change significantly
- New configuration fields added
- Startup performance becomes critical
