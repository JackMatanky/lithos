- Schema validation: 1 risk
- Context handling: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Validation Caching Logic Errors

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 4

**Description:** New validation caching mechanism could introduce subtle bugs where invalid properties pass validation or valid ones fail.

**Affected Components:**
- Property.Validate() method
- Schema validation pipeline

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive unit tests added
- Existing integration tests verify correctness
- Validation state is boolean with clear semantics

**Residual Risk:** Low - Tests provide good coverage

### PERF-001: Performance Optimizations Ineffective

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Medium (2) = 3

**Description:** Changes may not deliver expected performance improvements or could even degrade performance.

**Affected Components:**
- Regex compilation caching
- Validation short-circuiting

**Mitigation:**
- Added comprehensive benchmarks
- Performance measurements included in CI
- Easy rollback if benchmarks show regression

**Residual Risk:** Low - Benchmarks will catch issues

### REL-001: Context Propagation Breaks Cancellation

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) × **Impact**: Low (1) = 2

**Description:** Threading context through property bank loading could break existing cancellation behavior.

**Affected Components:**
- loadPropertyBank() method
- Schema loading pipeline

**Mitigation:**
- Context properly threaded from caller
- Existing tests verify cancellation still works
- No breaking changes to public APIs

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - Conservative implementation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None - no critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None - no high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Unit tests for validation caching logic
- Benchmarks for performance verification
- Integration tests for context propagation
- Regression tests for existing functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

All identified risks - mitigations in place

### Accepted Risks

None - implementation is low-risk

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Performance benchmarks in CI
- Error rates in schema validation
- Startup time metrics

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Performance benchmarks show unexpected results
- Schema validation errors increase
- User reports of validation issues
