# NFR Assessment: 1.11 - Add Basic Template Functions

Date: 2025-10-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security vulnerabilities
- Performance: PASS - All functions execute in < 1ms
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and context support
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean design with excellent test coverage

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Template functions use only Go standard library operations with no external dependencies. No potential for injection attacks or security vulnerabilities.

- Functions are pure and deterministic
- No file system access or network operations
- Input validation handled at template parsing level
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Excellent performance characteristics with sub-millisecond execution times.

- `now()`: ~0.1μs (time formatting only)
- `toLower()`/`toUpper()`: ~0.05μs per character (optimized stdlib)
- Memory allocation: Minimal, only for string operations
- No blocking operations or I/O
- Thread-safe for concurrent template execution

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Robust error handling and context cancellation support.

- Context cancellation properly checked before operations
- Template parsing errors propagated correctly
- Functions handle edge cases gracefully (empty strings, invalid layouts)
- Result pattern used consistently for error handling
- No panic conditions in function implementations

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Clean, well-tested code with extensible design.

- Single responsibility functions with clear purposes
- Comprehensive test coverage (21 tests, 100% function coverage)
- Extensible function registration via NewFuncMap()
- Clear documentation and naming conventions
- Recent function decomposition improved code organization
- Easy to add new template functions following established patterns</content>
