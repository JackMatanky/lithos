## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Go Version Mismatch in Project Tests

**Score: 2 (Low)**

**Category:** Technical

**Title:** TestGoModValidity expects Go 1.23 but go.mod specifies 1.24

**Description:** The project test TestGoModValidity checks for "go 1.23" in go.mod, but the file contains "go 1.24.0". This causes test failures unrelated to the story implementation.

**Probability:** Low (1) - Test is deterministic

**Impact:** Low (2) - Only affects test suite, not functionality

**Affected Components:**
- project_test.go
- go.mod

**Detection Method:** Test failure in CI/CD

**Mitigation Strategy:** Preventive

**Actions:**
- Update TestGoModValidity to accept Go 1.24
- Ensure test checks for minimum version compatibility

**Testing Requirements:**
- Update test to check for "go 1.24" or higher
- Verify test passes with current go.mod

**Residual Risk:** Minimal - cosmetic test issue

**Owner:** dev

**Timeline:** Next sprint

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Core Functionality Tests

- All CLI command execution paths
- Error handling and exit codes
- Dependency injection verification

### Priority 2: Edge Cases

- Invalid command arguments
- File system error conditions
- Command help and usage display

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are low impact and can be addressed in future sprints.

### Accepted Risks

- Go version test mismatch accepted for MVP
- Will be addressed in next development cycle

## Monitoring Requirements

- Test suite passes with -mod=readonly flag
- CLI commands execute successfully
- No runtime errors in command execution
