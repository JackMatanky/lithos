  - When: Format is validated against Keep a Changelog standard
  - Then: Proper version headers, sections, and formatting are present
  - Coverage: full

- **Integration Test**: `CHANGELOG links validity`
  - Given: CHANGELOG.md contains links to documentation and releases
  - When: Link validation is performed
  - Then: All referenced files and URLs exist and are accessible
  - Coverage: integration

- **Integration Test**: `CHANGELOG content completeness`
  - Given: CHANGELOG.md for version 0.1.0
  - When: Content is validated against Epic 1 deliverables
  - Then: All features, architecture components, testing, and documentation are documented
  - Coverage: integration

#### AC 1.15.3: Verify all tests pass

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `Full test suite execution`
  - Given: Complete codebase with all tests
  - When: `go test ./...` is executed
  - Then: All tests pass with 0 failures
  - Coverage: full

#### AC 1.15.4: Verify all linting passes

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `Linting execution`
  - Given: Complete codebase
  - When: `golangci-lint run` is executed
  - Then: No critical errors (minor test file issues acceptable)
  - Coverage: full

#### AC 1.15.5: Verify pre-commit hooks

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **E2E Test**: `Pre-commit hooks execution`
  - Given: Pre-commit configuration
  - When: `pre-commit run --all-files` is executed
  - Then: All hooks pass (gitleaks, gofmt, goimports, go vet, golangci-lint)
  - Coverage: full

#### AC 1.15.6: Committed with message

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `Commit message format validation`
  - Given: Git repository with recent commits
  - When: Latest commit message is checked
  - Then: Message follows conventional format "docs: update README and create CHANGELOG for Epic 1 release"
  - Coverage: integration

- **Integration Test**: `Commit content verification`
  - Given: Git repository with recent commits
  - When: Latest commit is analyzed
  - Then: Contains README.md and CHANGELOG.md changes, no other modifications
  - Coverage: integration

### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have comprehensive test coverage through the 18 test scenarios defined in the test design.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, the current test design provides excellent coverage:

1. **Unit Tests**: Validate content completeness and format compliance
2. **Integration Tests**: Verify syntax validity and link accuracy
3. **E2E Tests**: Ensure quality gates and manual processes work correctly

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: Documentation inaccuracies could mislead users
  - **Mitigation**: Comprehensive content validation tests
  - **Coverage**: Unit and integration tests provide strong validation

- **Medium Risk**: Broken links or invalid examples
  - **Mitigation**: Syntax validation and link checking
  - **Coverage**: Integration tests catch these issues

- **Low Risk**: Quality gate failures
  - **Mitigation**: E2E tests ensure gates pass
  - **Coverage**: Full E2E validation of all quality checks
