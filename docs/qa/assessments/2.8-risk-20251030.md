# Risk Profile: Story 2.8 - SchemaEngine Orchestrator

Date: 2025-10-30
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 3
- Risk Score: 15/100 (Low risk - well-mitigated core component)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## High Risk Issues

### 1. Schema Loading Pipeline Failure (Score: 6)
**Category:** TECH - Technical Risk
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Orchestration logic is complex
**Impact:** High (3) - Could prevent application startup

**Description:** The 4-stage pipeline (load→validate→resolve→register) has multiple failure points. If any stage fails, the entire schema system is unavailable.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for each stage failure
- Fail-fast behavior with clear error messages
- Detailed logging for troubleshooting
- Well-tested fakes ensure isolation

**Status:** Mitigated through extensive testing and error handling.

## Medium Risk Issues

### 2. Generic Accessor Type Safety (Score: 4)
**Category:** TECH
**Probability:** Low (1) - Go generics are compile-time safe
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Runtime type assertion could panic

**Description:** Generic Get/Has functions use type switches and assertions. While constrained to Schema|Property, incorrect usage could cause panics.

**Mitigation:**
- Compile-time constraints prevent misuse
- Clear documentation with examples
- Unit tests cover both valid and invalid types

### 3. Performance Impact of Schema Loading (Score: 4)
**Category:** PERF
**Probability:** Medium (2) - Loading happens at startup
**Impact:** Low (1) - One-time cost

**Description:** Schema loading and validation could be slow for large schema sets, affecting application startup time.

**Mitigation:**
- Detailed timing logs for monitoring
- Stage-by-stage performance tracking
- NFR3 observability requirements met

### 4. Error Message Consistency (Score: 4)
**Category:** REL
**Probability:** Low (1) - Error wrapping is consistent
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could complicate debugging

**Description:** Multiple error sources (ports, validator, resolver) need consistent error handling.

**Mitigation:**
- Consistent error wrapping with context
- Clear error messages at each stage
- Error logging before return

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 2 risks
- Performance: 1 risk
- Reliability: 1 risk
- Security: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component
- Load Pipeline: 1 risk
- Generic Accessors: 1 risk
- Error Handling: 1 risk
- Performance: 1 risk

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical/High Risk Tests
- Pipeline stage failure tests (5 scenarios)
- Generic accessor delegation tests
- Error propagation tests

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Performance logging verification
- Type safety edge cases
- Error message consistency

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| TECH-001 | Technical | Pipeline orchestration complexity | Medium | High | 6 | Mitigated |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Generic type safety | Low | Medium | 2 | Mitigated |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Startup loading performance | Medium | Low | 2 | Monitored |
| REL-001 | Reliability | Error handling consistency | Low | Medium | 2 | Mitigated |

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None - all risks adequately mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Monitor performance logs for loading times
- Consider caching for frequently accessed schemas

### Accepted Risks
- Generic function complexity (mitigated by tests and docs)
- Performance impact (acceptable for startup operation)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Schema loading duration logs
- Error rates during schema operations
- Generic accessor usage patterns

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Schema count grows significantly (>100 schemas)
- Performance issues reported in production
- New schema types added requiring generic extensions
- Error patterns emerge in logs
