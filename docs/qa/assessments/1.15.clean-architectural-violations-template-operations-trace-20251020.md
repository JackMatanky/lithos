  - Given: Updated constructor calls and imports
  - When: Tests run with new dependency injection
  - Then: All tests pass without import errors

### AC5: Existing Functionality Preserved

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Integration Test**: `tests/integration/new_command_test.go::TestNewCommand_Integration_CompleteFlow`
  - Given: User executes `lithos new` command
  - When: Command processes template with functions
  - Then: Output file created with correct content and functions applied

- **Template Pipeline Test**: `tests/integration/template_pipeline_test.go::TestTemplatePipelineIntegration`
  - Given: Complete template processing pipeline
  - When: Template is read, parsed, executed, and written
  - Then: Golden file comparison passes, functionality preserved

### AC6: Clean Architecture

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Code Structure Inspection**: Directory and file organization
  - Given: Project structure follows hexagonal architecture
  - When: Domain and infrastructure layers are examined
  - Then: Domain layer contains only business logic, no infrastructure concerns

- **Import Analysis**: Dependency direction validation
  - Given: Domain services and SPI adapters
  - When: Import relationships are analyzed
  - Then: Infrastructure depends on domain, not vice versa

### AC7: SPI Adapters

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **SPI Implementation Check**: `internal/adapters/spi/template/template_fs_adapter.go`
  - Given: SPI adapter implementation
  - When: Code is reviewed

- **Interface Compliance**: SPI port implementations
  - Given: SPI port definitions
  - When: Adapter implementations are verified
  - Then: All SPI ports properly implemented with infrastructure concerns only

### AC8: Dependency Integrity

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Dependency Injection Test**: Constructor signature updates
  - Given: Updated adapter constructors with dependency injection
  - When: Adapters are instantiated with proper dependencies
  - Then: All dependencies resolve correctly

  - When: Integration test executes
  - Then: All dependencies function together correctly

### AC9: Test Coverage Maintained

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Test Suite Execution**: Full test run
  - Given: Complete test suite before and after changes
  - When: All tests are executed

- **Coverage Analysis**: Test coverage metrics
  - Given: Test coverage measurements
  - When: Coverage is analyzed post-cleanup
  - Then: Coverage maintained or improved

### AC10: No Regressions

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

  - When: Full test suite runs after architectural changes
  - Then: All tests pass, no regressions introduced

- **Integration Validation**: End-to-end functionality
  - Given: Complete user workflows
  - When: Integration tests execute
  - Then: All user-facing functionality works as before

### AC11: Code Standards

## Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria have corresponding test coverage.

## Test Design Recommendations

Based on traceability analysis, the existing test suite adequately covers all requirements. No additional test scenarios are needed for this architectural cleanup story.

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: All requirements fully covered by existing comprehensive test suite
- **Validation**: Integration tests confirm end-to-end functionality preserved
- **Coverage**: Both unit and integration levels provide confidence in changes
