**Testing Focus**: Ensure all property resolution edge cases are tested

### 11. [TECH-006]: Schema Name Validation Edge Cases

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Schema name validation may not catch all invalid name patterns

**Testing Focus**: Schema name edge cases and lookup behavior

### 12. [DATA-002]: Property Immutability Enforcement

**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - ResolvedProperties immutability relies on convention rather than compile-time enforcement
**Impact**: Medium - Accidental modification of resolved properties could corrupt schema state
**Mitigation**:
- Add documentation emphasizing immutability requirements
- Consider implementing immutable data structures if Go ecosystem supports them
- Test that resolved properties cannot be modified after resolution
**Testing Focus**: Verify ResolvedProperties immutability is maintained

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (TECH-001, TECH-002) must be resolved or have comprehensive mitigation
- High-risk property resolution issues (DATA-001) must be thoroughly validated
- Concurrency safety must be verified with race detection

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Performance issues (PERF-001) with monitoring and fallback plans
- Error message quality issues with documentation improvements
- Context cancellation edge cases with operational procedures

### Accepted Risks

- Memory usage patterns with large collections (monitoring in place)
- Code complexity concerns (comprehensive test coverage provides mitigation)
- Schema name validation edge cases (existing validation provides adequate protection)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Performance metrics**: Schema resolution times, property merging performance
- **Memory usage**: Heap usage during schema loading, potential memory leaks
- **Error rates**: Schema resolution failures, cycle detection triggers
- **Concurrency safety**: Thread safety under load, cache corruption indicators

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Schema collection size exceeds 100 schemas
- Inheritance depth exceeds 5 levels in production
- Performance degradation reports from users
- Concurrency-related bugs are discovered
- New inheritance features are added (multiple inheritance, composition patterns)
