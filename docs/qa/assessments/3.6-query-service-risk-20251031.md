Date: 2025-10-31
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 0
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 100/100 (minimal risk)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 0 risks
- Security: 0 risks
- Performance: 0 risks
- Data: 0 risks
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 0 risks

### By Component
- QueryService: 0 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

No risks identified in this implementation. The QueryService demonstrates:

- Thread-safe concurrent access patterns
- Comprehensive error handling
- Proper resource management
- Clean architecture compliance
- Extensive test coverage

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
None required - no critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
None required - no high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
Standard functional and performance testing completed

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None - all risks mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
None required

### Accepted Risks
None - implementation is production-ready

## Monitoring Requirements

Standard application monitoring sufficient - no special risk monitoring required.

## Risk Review Triggers

- Architecture changes affecting concurrent access patterns
- Performance degradation in query operations
- Security updates to dependencies
- Changes to error handling patterns
