# NFR Assessment: 3.13

Date: 2025-11-02
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security issues introduced
- Performance: PASS - Minimal overhead from type normalization
- Reliability: PASS - Graceful cache directory handling
- Maintainability: CONCERNS - Test gaps impact maintainability

## Critical Issues

1. **Test Coverage Gaps** (Maintainability)
   - Risk: Untested type normalization logic
   - Fix: Add unit tests for numeric type matching

2. **Failing Unit Tests** (Reliability)
   - Risk: Potential runtime issues with path indexing
   - Fix: Correct Path field population in RefreshFromCache

## Quick Wins

- Fix failing tests: ~30 minutes
- Add type normalization test: ~15 minutes
- Refactor complex function: ~45 minutes
