## Critical Risks (Score â‰¥ 9)

None identified.

## High Risks (Score 6-8)

### SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability (Score: 6)

**Description:** The Read method could be vulnerable to directory traversal attacks if path validation fails.

**Probability:** Medium - Path validation is implemented but depends on correct absolute path comparison.

**Impact:** High - Could allow reading files outside vault, exposing sensitive system files.

**Current Mitigation:**
- Absolute path comparison in `isPathInVault`
- Rejects paths starting with `../`
- Comprehensive test coverage for traversal attempts

**Recommended Actions:**
- Consider additional validation layers
- Regular security audits of path handling code
- Monitor for bypass attempts in production

## Medium Risks (Score 4-5)

### REL-001: Filesystem Permission Errors (Score: 4)

**Description:** Permission denied errors during scanning could cause partial failures.

**Probability:** Medium - Common in multi-user environments or restrictive file permissions.

**Impact:** Medium - Could miss files during scanning, leading to incomplete indexing.

**Current Mitigation:**
- Graceful error handling (logs warning, continues)
- Comprehensive test coverage for permission scenarios
- Clear error messages with operation context

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor permission error rates in production
- Consider configurable error handling strategies
- Document permission requirements for vault directories

### PERF-001: Large Vault Scanning Performance (Score: 2)

**Description:** Full vault scans could be slow for very large vaults with thousands of files.

**Probability:** Low - MVP scope, large vaults not primary use case yet.

**Impact:** Medium - Could impact user experience during initial indexing.

**Current Mitigation:**
- ScanModified provides incremental scanning optimization
- Context cancellation support for long-running operations
- Debug logging includes duration metrics

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor scan performance in production
- Implement pagination for very large vaults (post-MVP)
- Consider background processing for large scans

## Low Risks (Score 1-3)

### DATA-001: File Content Corruption (Score: 1)

**Description:** File content could be corrupted during read operations.

**Probability:** Low - Uses standard Go filesystem operations.

**Impact:** Low - Would affect individual files, not entire vault.

**Current Mitigation:**
- Uses `os.ReadFile` which is well-tested
- Error handling captures read failures
- Test coverage includes various file types

**Recommended Actions:**
- Monitor for read error patterns
- Consider checksum validation for critical files (post-MVP)

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical/High Risk Tests

- Path traversal prevention tests (SEC-001)
- Permission error handling tests (REL-001)

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Large vault performance tests (PERF-001)
- File corruption detection tests (DATA-001)

### Priority 3: General Coverage

- Happy path functionality tests
- Edge case coverage
- Integration tests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Security Review**: Conduct security review of path validation logic
2. **Performance Monitoring**: Add metrics for scan duration and file counts
3. **Error Monitoring**: Implement alerting for permission errors

### Future Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Advanced Path Validation**: Consider additional security layers
2. **Performance Optimization**: Implement pagination for large vaults
3. **Error Recovery**: Add retry logic for transient permission errors

### Monitoring Requirements

- Scan duration metrics
- Permission error rates
- File count statistics
- Path validation failures

## Risk Acceptance

All identified risks are at acceptable levels for MVP release with current mitigations in place. The implementation includes comprehensive test coverage and proper error handling that addresses the primary concerns.

Regular monitoring and performance testing will help identify when optimizations become necessary as vault sizes grow.
