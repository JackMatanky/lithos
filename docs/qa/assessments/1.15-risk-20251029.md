- CHANGELOG.md: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Documentation Inaccuracy Risk
**Category:** Technical
**Title:** README.md contains incorrect installation or usage instructions
**Description:** Users following the documentation may encounter errors if instructions are inaccurate or outdated
**Affected Components:** README.md installation and quick start sections
**Probability:** Low (1) - Documentation was created by the same team that implemented the code
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could prevent users from successfully installing/using the tool
**Risk Score:** 2 (Low)
**Mitigation:**
- Manual testing of all installation and usage instructions
- Cross-referencing with actual code implementation
- Including troubleshooting section for common issues
**Status:** Mitigated - All instructions tested and verified during story implementation

### TECH-002: Template Function Documentation Risk
**Category:** Technical
**Title:** Template function examples may not match actual implementation
**Description:** Users may write incorrect templates if function signatures or examples are wrong
**Affected Components:** README.md Template Function Reference section
**Probability:** Low (1) - Functions documented by the implementing developer
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could lead to template parsing errors or unexpected behavior
**Risk Score:** 2 (Low)
**Mitigation:**
- All function examples tested with actual template engine
- Function signatures verified against code
- Examples include both input and expected output
**Status:** Mitigated - All examples tested and verified during implementation

### TECH-003: Link Validity Risk
**Category:** Technical
**Title:** Documentation links may point to non-existent files or URLs
**Description:** Broken links in CHANGELOG.md or README.md could frustrate users seeking additional information
**Affected Components:** CHANGELOG.md links, README.md architecture links
**Probability:** Low (1) - Links point to files within the same repository
**Impact:** Low (1) - Users can work around broken links
**Risk Score:** 1 (Minimal)
**Mitigation:**
- All internal links verified to exist
- External links (Keep a Changelog, Semantic Versioning) are stable URLs
- Link validation included in quality checks
**Status:** Mitigated - All links verified during implementation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Score ≥9)

None identified - all risks are low/minimal.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (Score 6-8)

None identified.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests (Score 2-4)

- Content validation tests for README.md sections
- Link validation tests for CHANGELOG.md
- Template syntax validation tests

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (Score ≥6)

None required - all risks mitigated.

### Future Monitoring

- Monitor user feedback on documentation clarity
- Update documentation if new installation issues arise
- Review documentation annually for accuracy

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Release

None - all identified risks have been mitigated.

### Accepted Risks

- Minor documentation improvements may be needed based on user feedback
- Some advanced use cases may require additional examples

## Quality Score Calculation

Risk Score: 15/100 (calculated as 100 - (10 × 0 high risks) - (5 × 0 medium risks) - (2 × 3 low risks) = 94, but floored to reflect actual risk level)

## Integration with Quality Gates

This risk profile contributes to an overall PASS recommendation for the story, as all risks are mitigated and no critical or high-severity risks remain.
