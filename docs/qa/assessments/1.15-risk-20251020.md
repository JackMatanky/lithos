# Risk Profile: Story 1.15

Date: 2025-10-20
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Medium Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 45/100 (calculated as average risk score weighted)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. TECH-001: Import Errors from Domain File Removal

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Files are being removed that may be imported elsewhere
**Impact**: High - Could cause compilation failures and break the application
**Mitigation**:

- Conduct comprehensive import audit before any file removal
- Use incremental removal approach with testing after each file
- Prepare rollback plan with git revert capability
- Update all import statements to reference domain services in `internal/app/template/`
- Run full compilation and test suite after each change

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (1 critical)
- Business: 1 risk (1 high)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 medium)

### By Component

- Template Operations: 5 risks
- SPI Adapters: 3 risks
- Domain Services: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | ------------------- |
| TECH-001 | Import errors from removing domain files | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical | Import audit, incremental removal, rollback plan |
| BUS-001 | Breaking existing functionality | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Full test suite, verify lithos new command |
| TECH-002 | Compilation failures | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Static analysis, build verification |
| OPS-001 | Test coverage gaps | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Maintain existing test coverage |
| TECH-003 | Dependency injection issues | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Low | Constructor signature validation |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Import dependency analysis test
- Compilation verification after each file removal
- Full integration test of lithos new command
- Static analysis for broken references

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- End-to-end template pipeline testing
- Regression test suite for all template operations
- Import resolution testing across all packages

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Unit tests for remaining SPI adapter
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting)
- Documentation update verification

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - Import errors must be resolved
- High risks affecting business functionality

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating monitoring
- Low risks with post-deployment verification

### Accepted Risks

- Minimal dependency injection issues if caught by testing

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Application startup and compilation success
- Template operation performance metrics
- Error logs for import or dependency issues
- Test suite execution results

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Additional files discovered with import dependencies
- Test failures indicate unexpected impacts
- Architecture changes affect template operations
- New requirements modify the cleanup scope
