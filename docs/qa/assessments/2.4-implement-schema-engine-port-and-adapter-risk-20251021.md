Date: 2025-10-21
Reviewer: Quinn

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 2
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 85/100

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. COMP-001: Compilation Failures (Score: 9)

**Probability**: High - Code does not compile
**Impact**: High - Implementation completely unusable
**Mitigation**: Fix all compilation errors immediately

### 2. FILE-001: Missing Implementation Files (Score: 9)

**Probability**: High - Referenced files don't exist
**Impact**: High - Core functionality missing
**Mitigation**: Create missing domain files

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 3 risks (2 critical)

### By Component

- Domain Layer: 2 risks
- Adapter Layer: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Status |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|--------|
| COMP-001 | Technical | Compilation errors | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Active |
| FILE-001 | Technical | Missing files | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Active |
| TEST-002 | Technical | Tests broken | High (3) | Medium (2) | 6 | Active |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Compilation validation tests
- File existence checks
- Basic functionality tests

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Integration tests for fixed components
- Regression tests for existing functionality

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All compilation errors resolved
- All missing files created
- Basic functionality working

### Accepted Risks

None - all risks must be addressed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Build success rates
- Test execution times
- Error rates in schema loading
