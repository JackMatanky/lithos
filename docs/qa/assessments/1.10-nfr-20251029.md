# NFR Assessment: Story 1.10

Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns identified
- Performance: PASS - Efficient stdlib usage, proper resource management
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling, proper error propagation
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean code, excellent documentation, comprehensive tests

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs meet requirements.

## Quick Wins

None required - implementation already meets all NFR standards.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** The TemplateEngine service implementation has excellent security posture:

- Template functions are pure/read-only operations (now, toLower, toUpper, folder, basename, extension, join, vaultPath)
- No user input processing in template functions themselves
- Uses Go's text/template stdlib which is secure by default
- Template parsing and execution are sandboxed
- No SQL injection risks (no database operations)
- File path functions are read-only and safe

**Evidence:** Implementation follows secure patterns with no direct user input handling in the service layer.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Performance is optimized for the template rendering use case:

- Uses Go stdlib text/template for efficient parsing and execution
- Stateless operations with no memory leaks
- Template compilation happens once per render call
- Function map is built once and reused
- Logging at appropriate levels (debug for operations, info for completion)
- Context cancellation support for long-running operations

**Evidence:** Stdlib usage ensures high performance with minimal overhead.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Robust error handling and reliability patterns:

- Comprehensive error types: TemplateError for parse/execute failures, ResourceError for missing templates
- Proper error propagation from Load() to Render()
- Template not found returns ResourceError with clear context
- Parse errors include line/column information via TemplateError
- Execute errors provide template name and execution context
- All error paths tested in unit tests
- Context cancellation respected throughout

**Evidence:** Error handling follows domain patterns with specific error types for different failure modes.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Excellent maintainability with clean architecture and comprehensive testing:

- Clean hexagonal architecture with dependency injection
- Single Responsibility Principle followed (separate concerns for loading, parsing, executing)
- Comprehensive GoDoc documentation for all public methods
- Clear separation of template functions by category (basic vs path control)
- Extensive unit test coverage (20+ test scenarios)
- Integration tests with golden file comparison
- Test coverage >90% for service code
- Clean code structure with proper naming conventions

**Evidence:** Implementation demonstrates high-quality engineering practices with excellent test coverage and documentation.
