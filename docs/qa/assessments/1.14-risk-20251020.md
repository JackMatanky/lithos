## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Template Parsing Performance
**Score: 2 (Low)** - Probability: Low (1) × Impact: Low (2)

**Category:** Technical - Performance
**Description:** Template parsing with custom functions may have performance implications for large templates
**Affected Components:** TemplateEngine, StaticTemplateParser
**Detection Method:** Code review of template processing logic
**Mitigation:**
- Template parsing uses Go's efficient text/template engine
- Custom functions are lightweight string operations
- Templates are parsed once and cached in domain objects
**Residual Risk:** Minimal - Go templates are optimized for performance

### TECH-002: Interface Coupling
**Score: 3 (Low)** - Probability: Medium (2) × Impact: Low (1)

**Category:** Technical - Architecture
**Description:** TemplateParser and TemplateExecutor interfaces may become tightly coupled over time
**Affected Components:** TemplateParser interface, TemplateExecutor interface
**Detection Method:** Architecture review of port definitions
**Mitigation:**
- Interfaces are kept lean (≤3 methods each)
- Separation of parsing vs execution concerns maintained
- Future refactoring can split if coupling becomes problematic
**Residual Risk:** Low - Interfaces follow single responsibility principle

### OPS-001: Test Maintenance Overhead
**Score: 4 (Medium)** - Probability: Medium (2) × Impact: Medium (2)

**Category:** Operational - Testing
**Description:** Complex test setup with multiple dependencies may increase maintenance burden
**Affected Components:** TemplateFSAdapter tests, integration tests
**Detection Method:** Test code complexity analysis
**Mitigation:**
- Tests use dependency injection patterns consistent with production code
- Mock implementations are simple and focused
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality
**Residual Risk:** Medium - Test complexity is justified by architectural benefits

## Risk Matrix

| Risk ID  | Description             | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ----------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Template parsing perf   | Low (1)     | Low (2)    | 2     | Low      |
| TECH-002 | Interface coupling      | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      |
| OPS-001  | Test maintenance        | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
**None** - No critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
**None** - No high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

#### Performance Testing
- Benchmark template parsing with various sizes
- Measure custom function execution time
- Profile memory usage for large templates

#### Architecture Testing
- Verify interface compliance through compilation
- Test dependency injection patterns
- Validate port/adapter boundaries

#### Maintenance Testing
- Ensure tests remain stable with code changes
- Verify mock implementations stay in sync
- Test refactoring doesn't break test dependencies

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- None - All risks are acceptable for this refactoring

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- OPS-001: Test maintenance complexity is acceptable given architectural benefits

### Accepted Risks
- TECH-001: Template performance is acceptable for current use cases
- TECH-002: Interface coupling risk is low and can be addressed in future if needed

## Monitoring Requirements

### Post-Deployment Monitoring
- Template processing performance metrics
- Error rates in template operations
- Test execution times and failure rates

### Alert Triggers
- Template processing time > 100ms (performance regression)
- Template parsing errors > 1% of requests
- Test suite execution time increases by >50%

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Template functionality expands significantly
- Performance issues reported in production
- New template features require interface changes
- Test maintenance becomes burdensome

## Risk Score Calculation

```
Base Score: 100
- TECH-001: -2 (Low risk)
- TECH-002: -2 (Low risk)
- OPS-001: -4 (Medium risk)
Final Score: 92/100 (Low Risk)
```

## Summary

The architectural refactoring introduces minimal risk with strong mitigations in place. The primary concerns are around long-term maintainability rather than immediate operational risks. All identified risks are acceptable for deployment given the significant architectural improvements achieved.
