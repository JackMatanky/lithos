# NFR Assessment: Story 3.6

Date: 2025-10-31
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security vulnerabilities identified
- Performance: PASS - O(1) lookups, concurrent read access
- Reliability: PASS - Thread-safe implementation, comprehensive error handling
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean, well-documented code following Go best practices

## Critical Issues

None identified - implementation meets all NFR requirements.

## Quick Wins

None required - all NFRs are satisfied.

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- No hardcoded secrets or sensitive data exposure
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- Thread-safe implementation prevents race condition exploits
- Input validation through type safety and bounds checking

**Evidence:**
- ResourceError used for missing resources (prevents path traversal)
- No external API calls or network operations
- Memory-safe operations with proper bounds checking

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- O(1) average case lookups for ByID and ByPath
- O(log n) worst case for ByFileClass (map operations)
- Concurrent read access via RWMutex (no blocking between readers)
- Memory efficient with in-memory indices
- No performance bottlenecks identified

**Evidence:**
- Map-based indices provide constant-time lookups
- RWMutex allows multiple concurrent readers
- No expensive operations in query paths
- Comprehensive test coverage including concurrent access

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Thread-safe concurrent access patterns
- Comprehensive error handling with domain-specific errors
- Graceful degradation for missing resources
- Atomic index rebuild operations
- Proper resource cleanup and lifecycle management

**Evidence:**
- sync.RWMutex ensures thread safety
- ResourceError for consistent error handling
- Lock-based RefreshFromCache prevents data races
- Extensive error path testing

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Clean, well-structured Go code following idioms
- Comprehensive documentation with GoDoc
- Clear separation of concerns
- Proper dependency injection
- Extensive test coverage (100%) with clear test names

**Evidence:**
- GoDoc comments on all exported functions
- Single responsibility principle followed
- Clean interface design
- Comprehensive test suite with descriptive names
- No linting violations
