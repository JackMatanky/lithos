Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns in CLI adapter implementation
- Performance: PASS - Simple CLI parsing, no performance issues
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and testing
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with high test coverage

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs are satisfied

## Quick Wins

None needed - implementation meets all NFR requirements

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- No input validation vulnerabilities in CLI argument parsing
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- No sensitive data handling in adapter layer
- User-friendly error messages don't expose internal details

**Notes:** CLI adapter follows secure coding practices with proper argument validation and error handling.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Simple command parsing with minimal overhead
- No complex algorithms or data processing
- Memory usage is negligible for CLI operations
- No blocking operations in command execution

**Notes:** Performance is not a concern for this CLI adapter implementation.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive error handling for all error types (ResourceError, TemplateError, generic errors)
- User-friendly error messages guide users to correct issues
- Proper context propagation in command execution
- Test coverage includes error scenarios

**Notes:** Error handling is robust and provides clear feedback to users.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Code follows SRP with clear method decomposition
- High test coverage (94.1%) ensures maintainability
- Well-documented code with GoDoc comments
- Clean separation of concerns between command building and execution

**Notes:** Code is well-structured and thoroughly tested, making it maintainable for future changes.
