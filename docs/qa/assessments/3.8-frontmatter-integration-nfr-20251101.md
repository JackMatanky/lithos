# NFR Assessment: 3.8

Date: 2025-11-01
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns identified
- Performance: CONCERNS - Performance impact not measured
- Reliability: PASS - Robust error handling implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean code structure and documentation

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs are either PASS or acceptable CONCERNS.

## Quick Wins

- Add performance benchmarking (1-2 hours)
- Implement integration tests (2-4 hours)

## Detailed Assessment

### Security
**Status: PASS**
**Evidence**: Frontmatter validation prevents malformed data from entering the system. No authentication/authorization changes. Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information.

### Performance
**Status: CONCERNS**
**Evidence**: Frontmatter processing adds overhead only for .md files, but no benchmarking performed to verify <10% target.
**Target**: <10% overhead for indexing time
**Current State**: Unknown - needs measurement

### Reliability
**Status: PASS**
**Evidence**: Validation failures logged but don't abort indexing. Graceful degradation for non-.md files. Thread-safe operations.

### Maintainability
**Status: PASS**
**Evidence**: Clean code structure with helper methods, comprehensive GoDoc, proper error handling, and test coverage.
