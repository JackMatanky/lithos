Date: 2025-10-21
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 15/100 (Low risk implementation)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks
- Business: 1 risk

### By Component

- Domain Model: 2 risks
- Integration: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Schema validation edge cases
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Possible edge cases in validation logic
**Impact**: Medium - Could allow invalid schemas to pass validation
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive unit tests covering validation scenarios
**Status**: Mitigated - 89.9% test coverage with table-driven tests

### TECH-002: Property model integration compatibility
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Potential integration issues with Property model
**Impact**: Medium - Could break schema property validation
**Mitigation**: Integration tests and shared test data validation
**Status**: Mitigated - Property model integration verified in tests

### BUS-001: Schema inheritance complexity
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Inheritance resolution handled by SchemaRegistry
**Impact**: Medium - Complex inheritance could cause validation issues
**Mitigation**: Domain model supports inheritance structure, resolution delegated to service layer
**Status**: Mitigated - String-based references with proper validation

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
None - no critical risks identified

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
None - no high risks identified

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Schema validation edge case testing (TECH-001)
- Property integration compatibility testing (TECH-002)
- Inheritance structure validation (BUS-001)

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None - all risks mitigated

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
All identified risks are mitigated through comprehensive testing

### Accepted Risks
None - all risks addressed

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- Schema validation error rates
- Property integration issues
- Inheritance resolution failures

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- Schema inheritance features are implemented
- Additional property types are added
- Validation logic is modified
