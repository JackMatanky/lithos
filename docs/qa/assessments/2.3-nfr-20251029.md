# NFR Assessment: Story 2.3 - PropertyBank Domain Model

Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns in domain model
- Performance: PASS - Simple map lookups, no performance issues
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and validation
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with good test coverage

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** PropertyBank domain model has no security concerns.

- No authentication/authorization logic
- No data exposure risks (read-only access)
- Input validation prevents malformed data
- No external dependencies or network calls

**Evidence:**
- Constructor validates all inputs
- Lookup returns copies, preventing data leakage
- No sensitive data handling

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** PropertyBank meets performance requirements for schema loading.

- Map lookups are O(1) operations
- No complex algorithms or computations
- Memory usage proportional to property count
- No I/O operations in domain layer

**Evidence:**
- Simple hash map operations
- No loops or expensive computations
- Test execution times <50ms for all scenarios
- Memory footprint minimal (properties map only)

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** PropertyBank demonstrates high reliability through comprehensive error handling.

- Constructor fails fast on invalid input
- All error paths tested and documented
- Error messages provide actionable context
- No panic conditions or undefined behavior

**Evidence:**
- 5 validation test scenarios covering error paths
- Error aggregation with multiple failure reporting
- Context propagation in error messages
- Defensive copying prevents state corruption

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** PropertyBank is highly maintainable with clear structure and comprehensive testing.

- Single responsibility: property registry
- Clear separation of concerns (validation, lookup, cloning)
- Comprehensive test coverage (8 tests, 100% AC coverage)
- Good documentation with GoDoc and examples

**Evidence:**
- SRP decomposition with helper functions
- 95%+ test coverage on new code
- Clear naming and documentation
- No complex dependencies or coupling

## Quick Wins

No improvements needed - all NFRs are satisfied.

## Critical Issues

None identified - PropertyBank implementation meets all quality attributes.
