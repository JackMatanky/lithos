# NFR Assessment: 3.5

Date: 2025-10-31
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security vulnerabilities identified
- Performance: PASS - Duration tracking implemented, efficient scanning
- Reliability: PASS - Resilient error handling, partial success acceptable
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean code, comprehensive tests, good documentation

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs meet requirements.

## Quick Wins

- Performance monitoring: Duration tracking implemented
- Error resilience: Cache failures logged but don't abort
- Test coverage: 97.4% with comprehensive scenarios

## Assessment Details

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- No hardcoded secrets or credentials
- Input validation through file extension filtering (.md only)
- Proper error handling prevents information leakage
- No SQL injection or other injection vulnerabilities
- File path handling is safe (no directory traversal)

**Notes:** MVP scope limits security surface, but implemented practices are sound.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Duration tracking implemented for NFR3 metrics
- Early .md file filtering optimizes scanning performance
- Stats collection happens efficiently during processing
- Suitable for MVP vault sizes (<1000 files)

**Notes:** Performance monitoring in place, can be optimized further for large vaults if needed.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Cache write failures logged as warnings, processing continues
- Vault scan failures abort appropriately (fatal)
- Partial success acceptable per resilient design
- Comprehensive error handling with appropriate abort vs continue logic
- Structured logging for all error conditions

**Notes:** Design prioritizes partial success over complete failure, appropriate for indexing operations.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Clean SRP decomposition with focused helper methods
- Comprehensive GoDoc documentation for all exported functions
- Unit tests with dependency injection and fakes (97.4% coverage)
- Clear separation of concerns (orchestration vs implementation)
- Well-structured code following Go conventions

**Notes:** Code is highly maintainable with excellent test coverage and documentation.
