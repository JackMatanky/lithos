# Risk Profile: Story 1.3

Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

Story 1.3 implements core domain models with minimal risk. All identified risks are low probability and impact, with no critical or high-risk items. The implementation follows established patterns and has comprehensive test coverage.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 2 risks (both low)
- Business: 0 risks
- Operational: 1 risk (low)

### By Impact
- Critical: 0
- High: 0
- Medium: 0
- Low: 3

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Template Parsing Complexity
**Score: 1 (Low)** - Probability: Low, Impact: Low
**Description:** Template model includes optional parsed AST field that could introduce complexity if not handled properly.
**Mitigation:** Comprehensive unit tests cover template initialization and parsing scenarios.
**Status:** Mitigated

### TECH-002: Embedded Struct Access Patterns
**Score: 1 (Low)** - Probability: Low, Impact: Low
**Description:** Note model uses embedded structs which could lead to confusion about field access.
**Mitigation:** Unit tests verify embedded struct access works correctly, documentation is clear.
**Status:** Mitigated

### OPS-001: Test Maintenance Overhead
**Score: 1 (Low)** - Probability: Low, Impact: Low
**Description:** High test coverage (100%) may require maintenance as models evolve.
**Mitigation:** Table-driven tests and clear test structure minimize maintenance burden.
**Status:** Accepted

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Core Functionality
- Constructor functions and computed fields
- Embedded struct access and delegation
- Error handling in helper functions

### Priority 2: Edge Cases
- Empty/nil inputs
- Complex file paths
- Invalid frontmatter data types

## Critical Gaps

None identified - all risks are low impact and properly mitigated.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

All risks are below threshold for blocking release. Story can proceed with standard testing.

## Monitoring Requirements

No special monitoring required - standard CI/CD test execution covers risk areas.
