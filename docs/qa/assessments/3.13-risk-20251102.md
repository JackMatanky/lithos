Date: 2025-11-02
Reviewer: Quinn

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1 (failing tests)
- Risk Score: 15/100

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Testing: 2 risks (1 high, 1 medium)

## Detailed Risk Register

### TEST-001: Failing Unit Tests (High Risk)

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High - Tests are currently failing
**Impact**: High - Broken tests indicate potential runtime issues
**Mitigation**: Fix Path field population in RefreshFromCache

### TEST-002: Missing Test Coverage (Medium Risk)

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium - Feature implemented but not tested
**Impact**: Medium - Type normalization may have edge cases
**Mitigation**: Add comprehensive test for numeric type matching

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Fix and validate RefreshFromCache unit tests
- Add type normalization test coverage

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- Integration tests for query layer end-to-end

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All failing unit tests
- Test coverage for AC4 type normalization

### Accepted Risks

None - all identified risks require mitigation.
