Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns identified
- Performance: PASS - Meets requirements with no performance issues
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and fail-fast behavior
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with clear initialization order

## Critical Issues

None identified - all NFRs are adequately addressed.

## Quick Wins

- All NFRs are properly implemented
- No immediate improvements needed
- Architecture v0.6.5 compliance maintained

## Assessment Details

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** No security concerns identified in the dependency injection implementation.

- Configuration loading is secure (no hardcoded secrets)
- No injection vulnerabilities in DI wiring
- Error messages don't expose sensitive information
- Template functions are safe (no code execution)

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Performance requirements are met with no bottlenecks identified.

- Application startup is efficient (5-layer initialization)
- No performance-critical operations in DI wiring
- Template rendering is optimized
- Memory usage is minimal for MVP scope

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** System reliability is ensured through proper error handling.

- Fail-fast behavior for configuration loading
- Comprehensive error handling in startup sequence
- Graceful error messages for users
- E2E tests validate complete workflow reliability

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Code is well-structured and maintainable.

- Clear 5-layer initialization order
- Comprehensive inline documentation
- Consistent dependency injection patterns
- Modular component design following hexagonal architecture
