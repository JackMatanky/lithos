- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive cycle detection and error recovery
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean code structure with 98.9% test coverage

## Critical Issues

No critical issues identified. Implementation demonstrates high quality across all assessed NFRs.

## Quick Wins

1. **Context cancellation handling**: Already implemented properly (~0 hours)
2. **Comprehensive error messages**: Already provides detailed cycle paths (~0 hours)
3. **Thread safety**: ResolvedProperties immutability already enforced (~0 hours)

## Detailed Assessment

### Security: PASS

**Input Validation:**
- ✅ Schema name validation prevents empty/invalid identifiers
- ✅ Self-reference detection catches `extends: "self"` scenarios
- ✅ Duplicate schema name detection prevents map corruption
- ✅ Parent schema existence validation before resolution

**Error Handling:**
- ✅ Comprehensive error wrapping with context (schema names, cycle paths)
- ✅ No panic conditions - all errors are properly caught and wrapped
- ✅ Input sanitization in `buildExcludeSet()` trims whitespace
- ✅ Context cancellation respected to prevent runaway operations

**Memory Safety:**
- ✅ Deep cloning of properties ensures immutability (AC 2.6.5)
- ✅ No shared mutable state between resolver instances
- ✅ Proper bounds checking in slice operations

### Performance: PASS

**Algorithmic Efficiency:**
- ✅ O(n) topological resolution using DFS with memoization
- ✅ Efficient cycle detection using resolution stack tracking
- ✅ Property merging uses map indexing for O(1) lookups
- ✅ Benchmark shows 51μs for 100 schemas (well under target)

**Memory Efficiency:**
- ✅ Caching prevents duplicate resolution work
- ✅ Pre-allocated slices with capacity hints
- ✅ Minimal memory allocations in hot paths

**Scalability:**
- ✅ Linear complexity scales well with schema count
- ✅ Early termination on cycle detection prevents exponential behavior
- ✅ Lazy resolution - only resolves requested schemas

### Reliability: PASS

**Cycle Detection:**
- ✅ Comprehensive cycle detection for direct (A→B→A) and indirect (A→B→C→A) cycles
- ✅ Clear error messages showing full cycle path: "a -> b -> c -> a"
- ✅ Self-reference detection during schema validation
- ✅ Stack-based tracking prevents infinite recursion

**Error Recovery:**
- ✅ Graceful handling of missing parent schemas
- ✅ Context cancellation support for long-running operations
- ✅ Atomic operations - partial failures don't corrupt state
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage (98.9%) including edge cases

**Robustness:**
- ✅ Handles empty schema lists gracefully
- ✅ Proper validation of all inputs before processing
- ✅ Thread-safe through immutable resolved properties
- ✅ Consistent behavior across all inheritance scenarios

### Maintainability: PASS

**Code Structure:**
- ✅ Clear separation of concerns with focused helper methods
- ✅ Single Responsibility Principle - each method has one purpose
- ✅ Builder pattern provides clean API for complex operations
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation with AC references

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ 98.9% test coverage exceeds target (≥95%)
- ✅ 15 distinct test scenarios covering all ACs
- ✅ Table-driven tests for multiple inheritance patterns
- ✅ Edge case coverage (empty inputs, cancellation, cycles)

**Code Quality:**
- ✅ All linting rules pass with 0 issues
- ✅ Follows project naming conventions and standards
- ✅ Clear variable names and function purposes
- ✅ Proper error context and logging integration

## Risk Assessment

**Low Risk Areas:**
- Algorithm correctness verified by comprehensive tests
- Performance characteristics well within acceptable bounds
- Security practices follow project standards
- Code maintainability supports future enhancement

**No Significant Risks Identified:**
All major inheritance scenarios and edge cases are covered with appropriate error handling and recovery mechanisms.
