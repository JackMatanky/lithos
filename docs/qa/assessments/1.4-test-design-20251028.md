# Test Design: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-10-28
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

- Total test scenarios: 3
- Unit tests: 3 (100%)
- Integration tests: 0
- E2E tests: 0
- Priority distribution: P0: 0, P1: 3, P2: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1.4.1: Create Config model with fields and constructors

**Coverage: FULL (via unit tests in AC 1.4.2)**

The Config model implementation is validated through the unit tests specified in AC 1.4.2. No additional test scenarios needed as this is pure implementation.

### AC 1.4.2: Create unit tests for constructors and immutability

**Coverage: FULL**

#### Scenarios

| ID           | Level | Priority | Test Description                  | Justification                          |
| ------------ | ----- | -------- | --------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 1.4-UNIT-001 | Unit  | P1       | NewConfig constructs with all fields | Pure constructor logic, validates field assignment |
| 1.4-UNIT-002 | Unit  | P1       | DefaultConfig uses correct defaults | Pure constructor logic, validates default values |
| 1.4-UNIT-003 | Unit  | P1       | Config is immutable (value object) | Core characteristic of DDD value object pattern |

**Detailed Test Scenarios:**

- **1.4-UNIT-001: NewConfig constructs with all fields**
  - Given: All required field values
  - When: NewConfig constructor is called
  - Then: Config struct is created with all fields set correctly
  - Justification: Unit test for pure constructor logic, no dependencies

- **1.4-UNIT-002: DefaultConfig uses correct defaults**
  - Given: No input parameters
  - When: DefaultConfig constructor is called
  - Then: Config struct is created with all specified default values
  - Justification: Unit test for pure constructor logic, validates default configuration

- **1.4-UNIT-003: Config is immutable**
  - Given: A Config instance
  - When: Attempting to modify fields (if public) or verifying no setters exist
  - Then: Fields cannot be modified after construction
  - Justification: Validates DDD value object pattern, ensures immutability

### AC 1.4.3: All tests pass

**Coverage: INTEGRATION (test execution)**

This AC is validated by running the test suite, which is an integration-level validation of the unit tests. No additional test scenarios needed.

### AC 1.4.4: All linting passes

**Coverage: QUALITY (static analysis)**

This AC validates code quality through linting tools. Not a test scenario per se, but ensures code meets quality standards.

### AC 1.4.5: Committed with message

**Coverage: PROCESS (version control)**

This AC validates proper commit practices. Not a test scenario.

## Risk Coverage

No specific risks identified for this foundational domain model implementation. The unit tests provide adequate coverage for the core functionality.

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P1 Unit tests (all scenarios) - Execute all unit tests to validate core functionality
2. Integration validation (AC 1.4.3) - Run test suite to ensure all tests pass
3. Quality validation (AC 1.4.4) - Run linting to ensure code quality

## Quality Checklist

- [x] Every AC has test coverage (AC 1.4.1 via unit tests, others via validation)
- [x] Test levels are appropriate (unit tests for domain logic)
- [x] No duplicate coverage across levels
- [x] Priorities align with business risk (P1 for core domain model)
- [x] Test IDs follow naming convention (1.4-UNIT-XXX)
- [x] Scenarios are atomic and independent
