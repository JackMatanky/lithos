Date: 2025-01-12
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Pure domain models with no security concerns
- Performance: PASS - Lightweight value types, no expensive operations
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage
- Maintainability: PASS - Clean code, 100% test coverage, excellent documentation

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**
**Assessment:** No security concerns identified. Implementation consists of pure domain models with:
- No authentication or authorization logic
- No data persistence or external API calls
- No handling of sensitive information
- No cryptographic operations
- Input validation handled at appropriate boundaries (not in domain layer)

### Performance

**Status: PASS**
**Assessment:** Excellent performance characteristics:
- All models are lightweight value types (no pointers except optional template AST)
- No expensive operations (string manipulation only)
- Computed fields cached in struct (basename, folder)
- Template model includes optional caching field for future optimization
- No memory leaks or resource intensive patterns

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**
**Assessment:** High reliability with robust error handling:
- Constructors handle edge cases (nil inputs, empty strings)
- Helper functions validate inputs appropriately
- Type assertions handled safely in frontmatter extraction
- Comprehensive unit tests cover failure scenarios
- No panics or undefined behavior

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**
**Assessment:** Outstanding maintainability:
- Clean, idiomatic Go code following established conventions
- Comprehensive documentation with package and function comments
- 100% unit test coverage with table-driven tests
- Clear separation of concerns between models
- No complex dependencies or coupling
- Easy to extend and modify

## Quick Wins

- Models are ready for immediate use in service layer
- No technical debt introduced
- Foundation established for reliable application development

## Recommendations

- Continue using these models as templates for future domain objects
- Maintain high test coverage standards established here
- Consider adding validation methods to enforce business rules at domain level
