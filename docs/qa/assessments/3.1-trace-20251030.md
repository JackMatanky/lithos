- Fully Covered: 6 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC 3.1.1: CacheWriterPort Interface

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Interface Compliance Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheWriterPortInterfaceCompliance`
  - Given: MockCacheWriter struct defined
  - When: Type assertion `var _ CacheWriterPort = (*MockCacheWriter)(nil)` executed
  - Then: Compilation succeeds, proving interface satisfaction

- **Persist Method Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheWriterPortPersistSignature`
  - Given: MockCacheWriter with Persist method
  - When: Persist called with context.Context and domain.Note
  - Then: Method signature matches interface contract

- **Delete Method Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheWriterPortDeleteSignature`
  - Given: MockCacheWriter with Delete method
  - When: Delete called with context.Context and domain.NoteID
  - Then: Method signature matches interface contract

#### AC 3.1.2: CacheReaderPort Interface

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Interface Compliance Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheReaderPortInterfaceCompliance`
  - Given: MockCacheReader struct defined
  - When: Type assertion `var _ CacheReaderPort = (*MockCacheReader)(nil)` executed
  - Then: Compilation succeeds, proving interface satisfaction

- **Read Method Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheReaderPortReadSignature`
  - Given: MockCacheReader with Read method
  - When: Read called with context.Context and domain.NoteID
  - Then: Returns domain.Note and error as per interface contract

- **List Method Test**: `cache_test.go::TestCacheReaderPortListSignature`
  - Given: MockCacheReader with List method
  - When: List called with context.Context
  - Then: Returns []domain.Note and error as per interface contract

#### AC 3.1.3: Documentation Requirements

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Interface Documentation**: `cache.go` comprehensive GoDoc
  - Given: Interface definitions in cache.go
  - When: GoDoc comments reviewed
  - Then: Thread-safety requirements, cache directory usage, CQRS pattern documented

#### AC 3.1.4: Mock Implementations

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Mock Implementations**: `cache_test.go` MockCacheWriter and MockCacheReader
  - Given: Mock structs defined with function fields
  - When: Interface compliance tests run
  - Then: Mocks satisfy interfaces and support controllable behavior

#### AC 3.1.5: Linting

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Lint Check**: `golangci-lint run ./internal/ports/spi`
  - Given: Code in internal/ports/spi/
  - When: Linting executed
  - Then: Zero issues reported

#### AC 3.1.6: Commit Message

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Commit Verification**: Git log shows proper conventional commit
  - Given: Changes committed to repository
  - When: Commit message checked
  - Then: Message follows "feat(ports): define CacheWriterPort and CacheReaderPort interfaces per CQRS pattern"

### Critical Gaps

None identified - all acceptance criteria fully covered by tests and implementation.

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None - interface definitions have no runtime behavior
- **Medium Risk**: Interface signature drift - mitigated by compile-time assertions
- **Low Risk**: Documentation inconsistencies - mitigated by comprehensive GoDoc

### Test Design Recommendations

Current test coverage is appropriate for interface definitions. No additional test types needed at this architectural level.
