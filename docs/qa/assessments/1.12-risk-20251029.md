## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Incomplete --view flag implementation
**Category:** Technical
**Score:** 2 (Low)
**Probability:** Low (1) × Impact: Low (2)

**Description:** The --view flag implementation has a TODO comment for reading note content. Currently displays empty content area.

**Mitigation:**
- Implementation is properly structured with flag parsing and display logic
- Test coverage includes --view flag scenarios
- Content reading can be implemented as separate task without breaking existing functionality

**Status:** Accepted - Non-blocking for MVP, content display enhancement can be added later

### BUS-001: CLI user experience dependency
**Category:** Business
**Score:** 4 (Medium)
**Probability:** Medium (2) × Impact: Medium (2)

**Description:** CLI is critical user interface for Lithos. Any issues with command parsing or error handling could impact user adoption.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive test coverage (94.1%) ensures reliability
- User-friendly error messages implemented
- Proper command structure with help and version commands
- Integration tests verify end-to-end functionality

**Status:** Mitigated - Strong test coverage and error handling reduce risk to acceptable level

### OPS-001: Dependency management complexity
**Category:** Operational
**Score:** 2 (Low)
**Probability:** Low (1) × Impact: Low (2)

**Description:** Addition of Cobra and pflag dependencies increases module complexity and potential for version conflicts.

**Mitigation:**
- Dependencies are well-established and stable (Cobra v1.10.1, pflag v1.0.10)
- Vendoring issues detected but don't affect functionality
- Dependencies follow Go module best practices

**Status:** Mitigated - Dependencies are stable and properly managed

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (Score ≥9)
None identified - no critical risks

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (Score 6-8)
None identified - no high risks

### Priority 3: Medium Risk Tests (Score 4-5)
- CLI command parsing validation
- Error message formatting verification
- Flag parsing edge cases

### Priority 4: Low Risk Tests (Score 2-3)
- Version command output
- Help command functionality
- Command structure validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
None - all risks are at acceptable levels

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- BUS-001: CLI user experience - mitigated through comprehensive testing

### Accepted Risks
- TECH-001: --view flag incomplete - accepted for MVP scope
- OPS-001: Dependency complexity - accepted as necessary for CLI functionality

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:
- CLI command success rates
- Error message clarity feedback
- User adoption metrics for CLI vs other interfaces

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:
- CLI usage patterns change significantly
- New CLI commands are added
- User feedback indicates usability issues
- Dependency updates introduce breaking changes
