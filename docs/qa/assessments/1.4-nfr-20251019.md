# NFR Assessment: Story 1.4

Date: 2025-10-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns for pure error handling package
- Performance: PASS - Efficient stdlib-only implementation with no allocations
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive test coverage (97.3%) and stdlib dependencies
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-documented, follows coding standards, high test coverage

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Pure Go package with no external dependencies (stdlib only)
- No network operations, I/O, or secrets handling
- Error types contain structured context but no sensitive data exposure
- No injection vulnerabilities or unsafe operations
- Follows security guidelines from architecture/security.md

**Evidence:**
- Uses only `errors` and `fmt` from stdlib
- Error messages follow consistent format: `"[ErrorType] context: message"`
- No untrusted input processing

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Zero-allocation error creation (value types, not pointers)
- Result[T] pattern is memory-efficient
- No performance-critical operations
- Uses stdlib functions which are optimized

**Evidence:**
- Error structs are value types (not pointers)
- No heap allocations in error creation paths
- Result[T] pattern avoids interface{} boxing where possible

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- 97.3% test coverage exceeds 85% requirement
- Comprehensive unit tests for all error types and Result[T] pattern
- Uses Go stdlib which is highly reliable
- No external dependencies that could introduce failures

**Evidence:**
- All error types tested with table-driven tests
- Result[T] pattern tested with multiple generic types
- Error wrapping and context functions tested
- Tests pass consistently

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Comprehensive README.md documentation
- Follows coding standards from architecture/coding-standards.md
- High test coverage enables safe refactoring
- Clear separation of concerns with domain-specific error types
- Factory functions provide consistent error creation

**Evidence:**
- Package includes detailed README with usage examples
- All functions under 60 lines, no nested control structures
- PascalCase for exported types, consistent naming
- Error types are well-documented with field descriptions</content>
