## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Category | Title | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|----------|-------|-------------|--------|-------|-------------------|
| TECH-001 | Technical | Incorrect implementation of custom template functions | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Comprehensive unit testing of all functions |
| TECH-002 | Technical | Template parsing errors not properly handled | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Implement TemplateError wrapping with context |
| PERF-001 | Performance | Inefficient template rendering for large templates | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Use Go stdlib text/template (proven performance) |
| SEC-001 | Security | Potential for template injection | Low (1) | High (3) | 3 | Use controlled template sources, no user input in templates |
| OPS-001 | Operational | Missing logging for template operations | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Implement debug/info level logging as specified |

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified - all risks are low to medium severity.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests (Score 4)

- TECH-001: Unit tests for all custom template functions (now, toLower, toUpper, path functions)
- Verify function outputs match specifications
- Test edge cases for path functions

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests (Score 2-3)

- TECH-002: Error handling tests for parse and execute errors
- SEC-001: Verify templates are from controlled sources only
- PERF-001: Basic performance validation
- OPS-001: Logging verification tests

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks mitigated through existing implementation approach.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified risks are addressed through:
  - Comprehensive unit testing (20+ test scenarios)
  - Proper error handling with domain-specific errors
  - Use of proven Go stdlib components
  - Controlled template sources

### Accepted Risks

None - implementation follows established patterns with low risk profile.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Template rendering success rates
- Error rates for template operations
- Performance metrics for template execution time

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Template complexity increases significantly
- User-generated templates are introduced
- Performance issues reported in production
- Security audit identifies new concerns

## Key Findings

1. **Low Overall Risk**: Implementation uses proven Go stdlib components with established patterns
2. **Testing Coverage**: Comprehensive test suite (21 scenarios) addresses primary risks
3. **Error Handling**: Proper domain-specific error types implemented
4. **Security**: Templates from controlled sources, no user input processing
5. **Performance**: Efficient stdlib usage with minimal resource overhead
