Date: 2025-10-19
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 7
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 36/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Score: 9 (Critical)**

**Probability**: High - Path traversal is a common attack vector, especially in file system operations where user input might influence file paths.

**Impact**: High - Could allow unauthorized access to sensitive files outside the intended vault directory, potentially leading to data breaches or system compromise.

**Mitigation**:

- Implement strict path validation and sanitization before any file operations
- Use filepath.Clean() and validate paths are within allowed directories
- Add path traversal detection and rejection
- Implement allowlist-based path validation for vault operations

**Testing Focus**: Security tests with malicious path inputs, fuzzing for path traversal attempts

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- Security testing with OWASP ZAP for path traversal
- Manual penetration testing of file operations
- Unit tests for path validation functions
- Integration tests with malicious path inputs

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- Cross-platform testing on Windows, Linux, macOS
- Atomic write failure simulation (disk full, permission denied)
- Temp file cleanup verification

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Performance benchmarks for large files
- Load testing with concurrent file operations
- Filesystem error condition testing

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9)
- High risks affecting security/data (scores 6)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Race condition risk accepted with note that filesystem operations are typically sequential in CLI context
- Large file performance risk accepted with documentation of recommended file size limits

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Security alerts for file access patterns
- Error rates for filesystem operations
- Performance metrics for file I/O operations
- Filesystem space monitoring

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Adding user-controlled file paths
- Supporting new filesystem types
- Changing vault directory structure
- Adding concurrent file operations
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in similar components

## Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability

**Strategy**: preventive

**Actions**:

- Implement path validation library or custom validation functions
- Add filepath.Clean() and directory boundary checks
- Create allowlist of permitted path patterns for vault operations

- Add cross-platform testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Document platform-specific behaviors in README
- Implement path normalization before operations

**Testing Requirements**:

- Unit tests on multiple platforms
- Integration tests with different path formats
