Date: 2025-11-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 15/100 (Low risk - comprehensive testing mitigates most concerns)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks
- Performance: 1 risk
- Operational: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Test Infrastructure Complexity
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex test setup could have bugs
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could mask real issues or create false positives

**Description**: The comprehensive test suite has complex setup code that could introduce bugs in the test infrastructure itself.

**Mitigation**:
- Code review of test helpers
- Run tests multiple times to ensure consistency
- Add test validation tests

**Status**: Mitigated - Test helpers are simple and well-tested

### PERF-001: Performance Test Flakiness
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Performance tests can be flaky on different systems
**Impact**: Low (2) - Would require re-running tests

**Description**: Performance benchmarks might fail on slower systems or under load.

**Mitigation**:
- Use reasonable time limits (30 seconds max)
- Focus on relative performance rather than absolute numbers
- Allow some variance in timing

**Status**: Mitigated - Test uses generous time limits and focuses on completion rather than exact timing

### TECH-002: Test Data Creation Issues
**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Test data creation is straightforward
**Impact**: Medium (3) - Could prevent tests from running

**Description**: Complex test vault creation could fail due to file system issues.

**Mitigation**:
- Use temporary directories
- Proper error handling in test setup
- Clear error messages for debugging

**Status**: Mitigated - Uses standard Go testing temp dirs with proper error handling

### OPS-001: Test Maintenance Burden
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - As system evolves, tests may need updates
**Impact**: Low (1) - Minor maintenance effort

**Description**: Comprehensive tests may need updates as the system changes.

**Mitigation**:
- Keep tests focused on integration points rather than implementation details
- Use descriptive test names and comments
- Regular test maintenance reviews

**Status**: Accepted - Normal maintenance cost for comprehensive testing

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests
- Performance test reliability validation
- Test infrastructure validation

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests
- Cross-platform testing
- Load testing scenarios

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- Test maintenance monitoring
- Documentation updates

## Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Production
None - all risks are mitigated or accepted

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Monitor performance test results on different systems
- Plan for regular test maintenance

### Accepted Risks
- Normal test maintenance overhead
- Performance test variance on different hardware

## Monitoring Requirements

- Test execution time monitoring
- Test failure rate tracking
- Performance benchmark trends
- Test maintenance effort tracking</content>
