Date: 2025-11-01
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 2
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 95/100 (minimal risk integration)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Performance: 1 risk
- Testing: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### PERF-001: Frontmatter Processing Overhead
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Frontmatter processing only affects .md files
**Impact**: Low - <10% overhead target is conservative
**Mitigation**: Performance verification required before production
**Status**: Monitored

### TEST-001: Missing Integration Tests
**Score: 2 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low - Unit tests provide good coverage
**Impact**: Low - Integration tests can be added post-implementation
**Mitigation**: Add integration tests in next sprint
**Status**: Accepted for MVP

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Performance Verification
- Benchmark indexing with/without frontmatter processing
- Verify <10% overhead for typical vault sizes

### Priority 2: Integration Testing
- End-to-end frontmatter workflow testing
- Error scenario coverage

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Performance verification (PERF-001)

### Accepted Risks
- Missing integration tests (TEST-001) - acceptable for MVP with unit test coverage

## Monitoring Requirements

- Performance metrics for frontmatter processing time
- Error rates for validation failures
- Test coverage metrics
