## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Value Object Pattern Complexity

**Category:** Technical
**Probability:** Low (1) - Well-established pattern
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could lead to misuse if not understood
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Config is implemented as immutable value object, but Go's pass-by-value semantics may confuse developers expecting reference types.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive GoDoc explaining immutability
- Clear examples in tests showing value semantics
- Code comments referencing DDD value object pattern

**Status:** Mitigated - Documentation and tests address this

### OPS-001: Configuration Loading Dependency

**Category:** Operational
**Probability:** Low (1) - Epic 3 handles loading
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Story only defines structure
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Config domain model depends on ConfigPort adapter (Epic 3) for actual loading, creating potential integration issues.

**Mitigation:**
- Clear documentation that domain model only defines structure
- Explicit separation of concerns in architecture
- Integration tests will validate loading in Epic 3

**Status:** Accepted - By design, loading is separate concern

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Core Functionality Tests

- Constructor default application
- JSON marshaling round-trip
- PropertyBankPath computation
- Immutability verification

### Priority 2: Edge Cases

- Empty string handling
- Path separator compatibility
- JSON tag validation

## Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are low and mitigated.

### Monitor

- Watch for developer confusion about value object semantics
- Ensure Epic 3 integration tests cover Config loading thoroughly

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

All identified risks are low-impact and properly mitigated through:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear architectural separation
- Thorough unit test coverage

Story can proceed with confidence.
