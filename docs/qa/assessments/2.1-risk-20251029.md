## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: Value Object Pattern Complexity

**Category:** Technical
**Probability:** Low (1) - Well-established pattern
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Could lead to misuse if not not understood
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Config is implemented as immutable value object, but Go's pass-by-value semantics may confuse developers expecting reference types.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive GoDoc explaining immutability
- Clear examples in tests showing value semantics
- Code comments referencing DDD value object pattern

**Status:** Mitigated - Documentation and tests address this

### TECH-002: Schema Validation Complexity

**Category:** Technical
**Probability:** Low (1) - SRP decomposition used
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Complex validation logic
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Schema validation involves multiple concerns (name, inheritance constraints, property delegation) that could become complex to maintain.

**Mitigation:**
- SRP decomposition with focused private methods
- Comprehensive test coverage for all validation paths
- Clear separation of validation concerns

**Status:** Mitigated - SRP design and tests address this

### OPS-001: Configuration Loading Dependency

**Category:** Operational
**Probability:** Low (1) - Epic 3 handles loading
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Story only defines structure
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Config domain model depends on ConfigPort adapter (Epic 3) for actual loading, creating potential integration issues.

**Mitigation:**
- Clear documentation that domain model only defines structure
- Explicit separation of concerns in architecture
- Integration tests will validate loading in Epic 3

**Status:** Accepted - By design, loading is separate concern

### OPS-002: Schema Inheritance Complexity

**Category:** Operational
**Probability:** Low (1) - Story 2.7 handles resolution
**Impact:** Medium (2) - Inheritance adds operational complexity
**Score:** 2 (Low)

**Description:**
Schema inheritance (Extends/Excludes) adds complexity that will be resolved by separate SchemaResolver service.

**Mitigation:**
- Clear separation between Schema definition and inheritance resolution
- Inheritance validation deferred to appropriate service
- Comprehensive documentation of inheritance semantics

**Status:** Accepted - By design, inheritance resolution is separate concern

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Core Functionality Tests

- Constructor default application
- JSON marshaling round-trip
- PropertyBankPath computation
- Immutability verification

### Priority 2: Edge Cases

- Empty string handling
- Path separator compatibility
- JSON tag validation

## Recommendations

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are low and mitigated.

### Monitor

- Watch for developer confusion about value object semantics
- Ensure Epic 3 integration tests cover Config loading thoroughly

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

All identified risks are low-impact and properly mitigated through:
- Comprehensive documentation
- Clear architectural separation
- Thorough unit test coverage

Story can proceed with confidence.
