# NFR Assessment: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-10-20
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns in configuration loading
- Performance: PASS - Configuration loading is efficient and happens at startup
- Reliability: PASS - Robust validation and error handling implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with comprehensive tests

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

Configuration loading is secure:
- No hardcoded secrets in the code
- Environment variables properly prefixed (LITHOS_*)
- YAML parsing is safe with viper
- Vault path validation prevents directory traversal
- No injection vulnerabilities in configuration handling

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

Performance characteristics are excellent:
- Configuration loaded once at startup, cached thereafter
- No runtime I/O for configuration access
- Path resolution is lightweight (string operations)
- Viper is optimized for configuration loading
- No performance bottlenecks identified

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

High reliability through:
- Startup validation fails fast on invalid configurations
- Clear error messages for troubleshooting
- Comprehensive test coverage for edge cases
- Proper error handling throughout the adapter
- Environment variable and file precedence works correctly

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

Code is highly maintainable:
- Clear separation of concerns (adapter vs model)
- Comprehensive documentation and comments
- Extensive unit test coverage
- Follows hexagonal architecture patterns
- Type-safe configuration with proper validation</content>
