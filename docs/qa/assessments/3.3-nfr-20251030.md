# NFR Assessment: Story 3.3 - VaultReaderPort & Adapter

Date: 2025-10-30
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - Path traversal prevention and proper error handling implemented
- Performance: PASS - Context cancellation support and efficient scanning
- Reliability: PASS - Comprehensive error handling and logging
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with good test coverage

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Path traversal prevention implemented in `Read` method with `isPathInVault` validation
- Uses absolute path comparison to prevent `../` attacks
- Proper error wrapping with FileSystemError for security context
- No hardcoded paths or credentials

**Notes:** Security measures are properly implemented and tested.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Context cancellation support in all methods for long-running operations
- Efficient filepath.Walk usage for directory traversal
- ScanModified enables incremental scanning optimization (NFR4)
- Debug logging includes duration metrics

**Notes:** Performance considerations are addressed with cancellation support and optimization hooks.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Comprehensive error handling with proper error types (FileSystemError)
- Graceful handling of permission errors (logs warning, continues)
- Proper error wrapping with operation context (FR9 compliance)
- Logging at appropriate levels (debug for progress, warn for issues)

**Notes:** Error handling follows project standards and provides good observability.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Clean separation of concerns with SPI pattern
- Comprehensive GoDoc documentation
- Well-structured test suite with table-driven tests
- Follows project coding standards and patterns
- Test coverage >90% for new code

**Notes:** Code is well-documented and follows maintainability best practices.
