Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 3
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 15/100 (minimal risk)

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks
- Operational: 1 risk

### By Component

- Dependency Injection: 2 risks
- E2E Testing: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: DI Wiring Complexity

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Well-documented patterns followed
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could cause startup failures if misconfigured
**Description**: Complex 5-layer dependency injection initialization could lead to runtime errors if components are wired incorrectly.

**Mitigation:**
- Comprehensive integration tests validate DI wiring
- Clear error messages for startup failures
- Well-documented initialization order in code comments

**Testing Focus:**
- Integration test for DI component initialization
- E2E test validates complete application startup

### TECH-002: Template Function Execution

**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Functions are simple and well-tested
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could produce incorrect output if functions fail
**Description**: Template functions (now, toLower, toUpper) must execute correctly during rendering.

**Mitigation:**
- Functions are simple and deterministic
- E2E tests validate function execution
- Error handling in template engine

**Testing Focus:**
- E2E tests verify template function outputs
- Integration tests for template engine

### OPS-001: Binary Build Process

**Score: 3 (Low)**
**Probability**: Low (1) - Standard Go build process
**Impact**: Low (1) - Build failures are easily detected
**Description**: E2E tests require building binary from source, could fail if dependencies change.

**Mitigation:**
- Use -mod=readonly for reproducible builds
- Clear error messages if build fails
- Automated build process in tests

**Testing Focus:**
- Build process tested in E2E setup
- Dependency management validated

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- DI wiring integration tests
- Template function E2E validation
- Build process verification

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- Error handling for missing templates
- Version command functionality
- Configuration loading

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None - all risks are low to medium with adequate mitigations.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

All identified risks have appropriate mitigations in place.

### Accepted Risks

- Low probability of DI wiring issues due to comprehensive testing
- Template function failures mitigated by E2E validation
- Build process risks addressed by reproducible builds

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Application startup success rate
- Template rendering error rates
- Build process reliability

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New dependencies added to DI
- Template functions modified
- Build process changes
- Configuration loading changes
