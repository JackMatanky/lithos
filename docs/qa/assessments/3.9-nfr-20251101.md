# NFR Assessment: Story 3.9

Date: 2025-11-01
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security issues, follows security.md guidelines
- Performance: PASS - Duration tracked and logged per PRD NFR3
- Reliability: PASS - Proper error handling and atomic writes implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Follows coding standards, >85% test coverage, linting clean

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- No authentication/authorization required (local vault operations)
- Input validation via schema validation (FR7 compliance)
- No secrets handling (no network/external APIs)
- Logs exclude sensitive data per security.md requirements
- Atomic file writes prevent data corruption

**Notes:** Command operates on local filesystem only, no external data exposure risks.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Duration tracking implemented and logged (IndexStats.Duration)
- No strict time requirements for MVP indexing (PRD NFR3)
- Performance monitored via structured logging
- CQRS optimization for read/write separation

**Notes:** Performance tracked but no SLA violations. Future benchmarking can establish baselines.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Error wrapping with context per error-handling-strategy.md
- Atomic temp-file → rename pattern for cache writes
- Structured logging with correlation IDs
- Domain-specific error types (CacheWriteError, FileSystemError)
- Context cancellation support
- Partial failure handling (continues indexing despite individual note failures)

**Notes:** Comprehensive error handling ensures graceful degradation and clear user feedback.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Evidence:**
- Follows coding-standards.md (Go 1.25+, idiomatic error handling)
- Test coverage >85% (unit + integration tests)
- golangci-lint passes with no violations
- Comprehensive GoDoc documentation
- SRP decomposition (separate concerns in CLI adapter)
- Table-driven unit tests
- Clear separation of concerns (ports/adapters pattern)

**Notes:** Code is well-structured, tested, and documented following project standards.</content>
