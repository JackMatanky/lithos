# NFR Assessment: Story 2.1 - Config and Schema Domain Models

Date: 2025-10-29
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns in domain models
- Performance: PASS - Simple struct operations, no performance issues
- Reliability: PASS - Pure data models with proper validation
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-documented, clear structure, SRP design

## Critical Issues

None identified - both domain models follow best practices.

## Quick Wins

None needed - implementations are straightforward and meet all NFRs.

## Detailed Assessment

### Config Model

**Security:** ✅ PASS - No user input handling, no external dependencies, pure data structure.

**Performance:** ✅ PASS - Simple struct with basic operations, no loops or complex computations.

**Reliability:** ✅ PASS - No error handling needed (pure data), constructor ensures valid state.

**Maintainability:** ✅ PASS - Single responsibility, comprehensive documentation, clear field purposes.

### Schema Model

**Security:** ✅ PASS - No user input handling, validation prevents malicious schema definitions.

**Performance:** ✅ PASS - Linear validation (O(n) for properties), acceptable for schema loading.

**Reliability:** ✅ PASS - Comprehensive validation with proper error aggregation and context.

**Maintainability:** ✅ PASS - SRP decomposition of validation logic, clear method responsibilities, extensive test coverage.
