# NFR Assessment: Story 1.14

Date: 2025-10-20
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns introduced
- Performance: PASS - Template processing efficiency maintained
- Reliability: PASS - Improved error handling and architectural stability
- Maintainability: PASS - Hexagonal architecture significantly improves code maintainability

## Critical Issues

**None identified** - The architectural refactoring improves all NFRs.

## Quick Wins

- **Architectural Benefits**: Hexagonal architecture provides better separation of concerns
- **Error Handling**: Improved error propagation through architectural layers
- **Testability**: Domain services are now fully unit testable
- **Maintainability**: Clear boundaries between layers reduce coupling

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- No new security surfaces introduced
- Template processing follows existing secure patterns
- Error handling prevents information leakage
- File operations use established secure filesystem interfaces

**Evidence:**
- Template functions are safe string operations
- File I/O uses existing FileSystemPort with proper error handling
- No new external dependencies or network operations

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Template parsing uses Go's optimized text/template engine
- Custom functions are lightweight operations
- File I/O performance unchanged from previous implementation
- Memory usage remains efficient for template processing

**Evidence:**
- Templates are parsed once and cached in domain objects
- No performance regression in integration tests
- Custom functions (now, toLower, toUpper) are computationally inexpensive

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Improved error handling through architectural layers
- Better separation of concerns reduces failure points
- Dependency injection ensures proper initialization
- Comprehensive test coverage validates reliability

**Evidence:**
- Error propagation tested through all layers
- Integration tests verify end-to-end reliability
- Unit tests cover error scenarios in domain services

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Hexagonal architecture provides clear separation of concerns
- Domain logic isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Port/adapter pattern enables easy testing and replacement
- Code is more modular and follows single responsibility principle

**Evidence:**
- Domain services are pure business logic
- SPI adapters handle infrastructure concerns
- Interfaces define clear contracts between layers
- Comprehensive unit test coverage for all new components
