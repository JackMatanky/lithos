# NFR Assessment: 3.1 - Define Cache Port Interfaces

Date: 2025-10-30
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns for interface definitions
- Performance: PASS - No performance impact for interfaces
- Reliability: PASS - Interfaces are inherently reliable
- Maintainability: PASS - Excellent documentation and clear contracts

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Interface definitions have no security implications. Security concerns will be addressed in adapter implementations (Story 3.2) through proper input validation, access controls, and secure filesystem operations.

**Evidence:** Interfaces only define method signatures with context and domain types. No authentication, authorization, or data handling logic present.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Interfaces have zero runtime performance impact. Performance characteristics will be determined by adapter implementations using atomic writes, optional memoization, and efficient I/O patterns.

**Evidence:** Pure interface contracts with no implementation. Performance expectations clearly documented in GoDoc comments.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Interfaces provide reliable contracts for error handling and context cancellation. Reliability depends on adapter implementations following documented patterns.

**Evidence:** Comprehensive error handling requirements documented, context cancellation support required, thread-safety expectations clear.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:** Excellent maintainability with comprehensive GoDoc, clear CQRS separation, and well-defined contracts. Interfaces follow hexagonal architecture principles.

**Evidence:**
- Detailed GoDoc with examples and behavioral contracts
- Clear separation of write vs read concerns
- Thread-safety and error handling requirements documented
- Functional requirements traceability (FR6, FR9)
- Code follows Go best practices and linting standards</content>

Since this is a low-risk interface definition story, no separate risk profile assessment needed. The interfaces introduce no new risks - they only define contracts that implementations must follow.

### NFR Assessment

NFR assessment completed: docs/qa/assessments/3.1-nfr-20251030.md

### Test Architecture Assessment

**Test Coverage:** Excellent - 6 unit tests covering all interface signatures and compliance.

**Test Quality:** High - Compile-time assertions ensure interface stability, mock implementations support testing.

**Test Level Appropriateness:** Perfect - Unit tests for interface contracts, no integration needed at this level.

### Technical Debt Identification

**No technical debt identified.** The implementation is clean, well-documented, and follows all architectural guidelines.

### Active Refactoring

No refactoring needed - the code is already of high quality.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards:** ✅ PASS - Follows Go conventions, comprehensive GoDoc
- **Project Structure:** ✅ PASS - Interfaces in correct location per architecture
- **Testing Strategy:** ✅ PASS - Interface compliance tests implemented
- **All ACs Met:** ✅ PASS - All acceptance criteria satisfied

### Files Modified During Review

None - no changes needed.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/3.1-cache-port-interfaces.yml
