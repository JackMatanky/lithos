# NFR Assessment: 2.8 - SchemaEngine Orchestrator

Date: 2025-10-30
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS - No security concerns in schema orchestration
- Performance: PASS - Meets NFR3 observability with timing logs
- Reliability: PASS - Fail-fast error handling with comprehensive logging
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-documented generics with comprehensive tests

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** SchemaEngine handles data loading and validation but doesn't introduce security vulnerabilities. Input validation delegated to SchemaValidator, access control to SchemaRegistryPort. No direct user input processing.

### Performance

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** Load() method includes detailed timing measurements for each stage (NFR3 indexing observability). Total duration logged. No performance bottlenecks identified in orchestration logic.

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** Fail-fast behavior ensures any stage failure stops pipeline immediately. Comprehensive error wrapping with context. All error paths tested. Logging provides observability for troubleshooting.

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**
**Notes:** Excellent GoDoc documentation with examples. Generic functions well-documented. Test coverage comprehensive (17 unit tests). Code follows SRP with clear separation of concerns. Private methods for stage decomposition.
