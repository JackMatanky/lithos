# NFR Assessment: 1.7

Date: 2025-10-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: CONCERNS - File permissions not explicitly controlled on final files
- Performance: PASS - Standard file I/O with necessary atomic write overhead
- Reliability: PASS - Atomic writes and proper error handling implemented
- Maintainability: PASS - Well-structured code with comprehensive documentation and tests

## Critical Issues

1. **File Permissions** (Security)
   - Risk: Final files may inherit default permissions instead of controlled access
   - Fix: Explicitly set file permissions after atomic rename or during temp file creation

## Quick Wins

- Add explicit file permission setting in WriteFileAtomic method
- Add security tests for file permission validation
- Consider path validation in adapter for additional security

## Detailed Assessment

### Security

**Status: CONCERNS**

**Assessment:**
- Path validation assumed to be handled by caller (commented in ReadFile)
- Directory permissions set to 0750 (good)
- Atomic write prevents partial read exposure
- **Issue:** Final file permissions not explicitly controlled - temp file created with default permissions, rename may preserve them

**Evidence:**
- `os.MkdirAll(dir, 0o750)` - good directory permissions
- `os.CreateTemp()` - uses default file permissions
- No explicit chmod after rename

### Performance

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Standard Go stdlib file operations
- Atomic writes add necessary overhead for data integrity
- Walk uses efficient `filepath.WalkDir`
- No performance bottlenecks identified

**Evidence:**
- `os.ReadFile()` - standard performant read
- Temp file + rename pattern - standard atomic write
- `file.Sync()` - ensures durability

### Reliability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Atomic write guarantees prevent partial writes
- Proper error handling with cleanup
- File sync ensures durability
- Walk handles errors appropriately

**Evidence:**
- Temp file cleanup on error (defer)
- `file.Sync()` before close
- `os.Rename()` for atomic operation
- Error propagation in Walk

### Maintainability

**Status: PASS**

**Assessment:**
- Clean separation of concerns (port vs adapter)
- Comprehensive documentation
- Unit tests implemented (7 tests per story)
- Follows project coding standards
- Modular helper functions

**Evidence:**
- Interface defined in separate package
- Detailed GoDoc comments
- Helper methods for complex operations
- Test coverage target â‰¥85%
