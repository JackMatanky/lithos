  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Benchmark tests included for startup optimization. O(nÂ²) complexity acceptable for startup-time resolution. No concurrent access during resolution.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Unit tests provide excellent maintainability with clear AC mapping and comprehensive coverage'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling and edge case coverage including cycle detection and validation'
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No concurrency safety issues - resolver operates at startup in single-threaded context per architecture'
