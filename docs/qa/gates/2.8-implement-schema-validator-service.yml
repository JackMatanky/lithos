# Review findings summary
findings:
  architectural:
    - "Successfully extracted ALL validation methods from domain models to SchemaValidator service"
    - "Successfully extracted ALL business logic methods from domain models to SchemaEngine service"
    - "Domain models are now pure data structures with no validation or business logic methods"
    - "SchemaEngine properly serves as the ONLY gateway for schema operations"
    - "Proper hexagonal architecture boundaries established"
    - "Clean Result[T] pattern integration throughout"

  code_quality:
    - "0 linting issues after golines and godot fixes"
    - "Comprehensive PropertySpec polymorphism implementation"
    - "Proper context cancellation support in all operations"
    - "Excellent error handling with field-level validation details"
    - "Well-structured table-driven tests"

  bugs_fixed:
    - "Fixed step validation bug in NumberPropertySpec (only handled step=1.0, ignored other step values)"

  improvements_made:
    - "Added 16 comprehensive PropertySpec validation test cases"
    - "Improved test coverage from 59.3% to 79.2% for schema package"
    - "Added ptrFloat64 test helper for cleaner test code"
