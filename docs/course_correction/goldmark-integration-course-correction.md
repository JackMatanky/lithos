# Sprint Change Proposal: Goldmark Library Integration

**Date:** Thu Oct 30 2025
**Initiated By:** Sarah (Product Owner)
**Change Trigger:** Discovery of goldmark library for Go markdown processing
**Document Version:** 1.0
**Status:** Approved

## Executive Summary

The discovery of the goldmark library (https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/yuin/goldmark) represents a significant opportunity to enhance the Lithos project's markdown processing capabilities. This course correction analyzes the potential integration of goldmark as a replacement for custom markdown handling implementations, providing a structured path forward to maintain project momentum while capitalizing on this technical improvement.

## Identified Issue Summary

### Current State
The Lithos project currently handles markdown processing through:
- Custom delimiter detection for frontmatter extraction
- Standard library string manipulation for heading parsing
- Basic template rendering without advanced markdown features
- Manual parsing of markdown content in various services

### Opportunity
Goldmark is a fast, extensible markdown parser/renderer for Go that offers:
- **Performance:** Significantly faster than custom implementations
- **Extensibility:** Plugin system for custom markdown extensions
- **Standards Compliance:** Full CommonMark support with extensions
- **AST Access:** Abstract Syntax Tree for advanced content analysis
- **Active Maintenance:** Well-maintained with regular updates

### Potential Impact
This library could simplify and improve:
- Frontmatter extraction in the vault indexing engine
- Heading parsing for document structure analysis
- Template rendering with proper markdown support
- Content validation and processing across all markdown-related functionality

## Epic Impact Analysis

### Current Epic Impact Assessment

#### Epic 1: Foundational CLI Static Template Engine
- **Current Implementation:** Template rendering to markdown strings using basic string operations
- **Goldmark Opportunity:** Enhanced rendering with proper markdown parsing, support for complex templates
- **Impact Level:** Medium - Could improve template output quality and add features like table rendering

#### Epic 3: Vault Indexing Engine
- **Current Implementation:** Frontmatter extraction using custom delimiter detection, heading parsing with regex
- **Goldmark Opportunity:** AST-based parsing for more reliable frontmatter and heading extraction
- **Impact Level:** High - Direct improvement to core vault functionality mentioned in data-models.md

#### Epic 5: Schema-Driven Lookups Validation

  - Enhanced robustness for edge cases (code blocks containing ---, etc.)
  - Performance improvement verified (2-3x faster extraction)
  - Backward compatibility maintained with existing markdown files

#### Future Stories (Incremental Integration)
- **Template Stories:** Add goldmark rendering acceptance criteria when relevant
- **Indexing Stories:** Add heading extraction acceptance criteria when relevant
- **Any Markdown Processing:** Leverage goldmark capabilities organically

#### Implementation Notes
- Integration happens as part of ongoing development, not separate effort
- Each story validates goldmark benefits in its specific context
- Architecture docs updated to reflect approved technical direction
- No disruption to current sprint planning

## Recommended Path Forward

### Chosen Path: Incremental Integration (REVISED)

**Rationale:**
- More efficient than separate integration epic - eliminates overhead and delay
- Immediate benefits realized in Story 3.5 rather than waiting for separate effort
- Natural testing and validation through existing story acceptance criteria
- Maintains clean architecture while reducing timeline and effort

**Previous Alternative (Deferred):** Create separate Epic 6 for goldmark integration
- Pros: Clean separation of concerns
- Cons: Creates inefficiency, delays benefits, adds overhead

### Implementation Approach

1. **Story 3.5 Enhancement:** Add goldmark to FrontmatterService for AST-based extraction
   - Add goldmark v1.7.4 to go.mod
   - Replace simple delimiter detection with goldmark AST parsing
   - Add performance validation (verify 2-3x improvement)
   - Maintain backward compatibility

2. **Future Incremental Integration:** Add goldmark features as relevant stories arise
   - Template rendering stories → goldmark rendering capabilities
   - Vault indexing stories → heading extraction features
   - Any markdown processing → goldmark enhancements

3. **Architecture Updates:** Reflect goldmark as approved technical direction
   - Tech stack updated with goldmark entry
   - Component descriptions updated for goldmark integration
   - Data models updated for enhanced processing capabilities

### Effort Estimate
- **Story Points:** 2-3 additional points for Story 3.5 enhancement
- **Timeline:** Integration happens organically as part of current development
- **Risk Level:** Very Low (incremental changes within existing story validation)

### Risk Assessment
- **Technical Risk:** Low - goldmark is mature, actively maintained, widely used
- **Integration Risk:** Low - can be implemented incrementally with feature flags
- **Performance Risk:** Low - goldmark is known for excellent performance
- **Compatibility Risk:** Low - maintains CommonMark standards, backward compatible
