# Epic 2 Story Fixes Summary

## Overview

All critical issues identified in the validation report for Stories 2.3-2.7 have been addressed. This document summarizes the fixes implemented to ensure proper implementation readiness and dependency management.

## Story Status Updates

### Story 2.3: Property Domain Models
**Status Changed**: Approved → Draft
**Rationale**: Story was marked as approved but had incomplete tasks

### Story 2.4: Schema Loader Port and Adapter
**Status Changed**: Approved → Draft
**Rationale**: Story was marked as approved but had incomplete tasks

### Story 2.5: Basic Schema Registry Service
**Status Changed**: Approved → Draft
**Rationale**: Story was marked as approved but had incomplete tasks

### Story 2.6: Inheritance Resolution
**Status Changed**: Approved → Draft
**Rationale**: Story had duplicate task definitions and incomplete implementation

### Story 2.7: Schema Validator Service
**Status Maintained**: Draft
**Rationale**: Story was correctly in draft status but needed significant enhancements

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Architecture Boundary Clarifications

**Story 2.3 - Property Domain Models:**
- ✅ Clarified that domain models should be serialization-free
- ✅ Added guidance for adapter-domain boundary with constructors
- ✅ Removed JSON handling from domain model responsibilities
- ✅ Enhanced task descriptions to specify adapter integration requirements

**Story 2.4 - Schema Loader Port and Adapter:**
- ✅ Updated interface to return domain objects directly (Schema, PropertyBank vs DTOs)
- ✅ Clarified that adapter handles JSON parsing and PropertySpec discriminator logic
- ✅ Enhanced tasks to specify domain constructor usage pattern
- ✅ Added security validation and error handling specifications

### 2. Task Completion and Consistency Issues

**All Stories (2.3-2.7):**
- ✅ Updated task lists to reflect actual implementation requirements
- ✅ Added specific guidance for adapter-domain integration patterns
- ✅ Enhanced testing requirements with concrete scenarios
- ✅ Added proper dependency chain documentation

**Story 2.6 - Inheritance Resolution:**
- ✅ Fixed duplicate Task 4 definitions
- ✅ Reordered tasks in logical sequence
- ✅ Enhanced algorithmic specifications for inheritance resolution
- ✅ Added specific cycle detection and property merging requirements

### 3. Dependency Chain Management

**All Stories:**
- ✅ Added clear dependency documentation in QA Results sections
- ✅ Enhanced technical constraints with cross-story references
- ✅ Updated Definition of Done criteria to reflect dependency requirements

**Dependency Chain Clarified:**
```
Story 2.1 (Config) → Ready ✅
Story 2.2 (Schema Model) → Story 2.3 (Property Models) →
Story 2.4 (Engine Port/Adapter) → Story 2.5 (Registry) →
Story 2.6 (Inheritance) → Story 2.7 (Validator)
```

### 4. Interface and Error Handling Improvements

**Story 2.5 - Schema Registry Service:**
- ✅ Added SchemaRegistryPort interface specification
- ✅ Enhanced Result[T] pattern implementation requirements
- ✅ Added structured error types (SchemaNotFoundError, SchemaLoadError)
- ✅ Enhanced thread-safety requirements with sync.RWMutex patterns

**Story 2.7 - Schema Validator Service:**
- ✅ Added SchemaValidatorPort interface specification
- ✅ Enhanced ValidationError type specifications with field-level details
- ✅ Added comprehensive PropertySpec polymorphism testing requirements
- ✅ Clarified inheritance validation against ResolvedProperties

### 5. Testing and Quality Requirements

**All Stories:**
- ✅ Enhanced unit testing requirements with specific scenarios
- ✅ Added integration testing for adapter-domain boundaries
- ✅ Specified coverage targets (≥85% for app layer)
- ✅ Added concurrent access testing for Registry components

### 6. QA Results Sections

**All Stories:**
- ✅ Added comprehensive QA Results sections with pre-implementation reviews
- ✅ Documented critical dependencies for each story
- ✅ Provided specific recommendations for implementation approach
- ✅ Identified integration points that need attention

## Implementation Guidance

### Sequential Implementation Order

1. **Story 2.1**: ✅ Ready for implementation (already complete)
2. **Story 2.2**: Complete Schema domain model first
3. **Story 2.3**: Implement Property models with constructors for adapter use
4. **Story 2.4**: Implement adapter with JSON parsing and domain object creation
5. **Story 2.5**: Implement registry service with thread-safe patterns
6. **Story 2.6**: Add inheritance resolution to registry
7. **Story 2.7**: Implement validator with PropertySpec polymorphism

### Key Integration Patterns

**Adapter-Domain Boundary:**
- Adapters handle JSON parsing, infrastructure concerns
- Domain provides constructors and validation logic
- Clear separation maintained per hexagonal architecture

**Error Handling:**
- Result[T] pattern used consistently across domain services
- Structured error types with field-level details
- Proper error aggregation for complex validation scenarios

**Thread Safety:**
- Registry package used for concurrent access patterns
- sync.RWMutex for read-heavy access patterns
- Immutable ResolvedProperties after inheritance resolution

## Validation Status

After implementing these fixes:

### ✅ Architecture Compliance
- Clear domain-adapter boundaries established
- Hexagonal architecture patterns maintained
- No infrastructure leakage into domain models

### ✅ Dependency Management
- Sequential implementation order clarified
- Cross-story dependencies documented
- Integration points specified

### ✅ Implementation Readiness
- All tasks properly specified with actionable items
- Testing requirements comprehensive
- Error handling patterns consistent

### ✅ Quality Assurance
- QA Results sections provide clear guidance
- Critical issues identified and addressed
- Pre-implementation reviews complete

## Next Steps

1. **Review and approve** updated story specifications
2. **Begin implementation** following sequential order (2.2 → 2.3 → 2.4 → 2.5 → 2.6 → 2.7)
3. **Ensure** each story completion before proceeding to next
4. **Validate** adapter-domain integration at each boundary
5. **Test** inheritance resolution thoroughly before Story 2.7 implementation

## Success Criteria

Epic 2 will be successfully implemented when:
- ✅ All stories completed in dependency order
- ✅ Schema loading, inheritance, and validation working end-to-end
- ✅ Thread-safe registry operations under concurrent access
- ✅ PropertySpec polymorphism supporting all validation scenarios
- ✅ Clean adapter-domain boundaries maintained throughout
