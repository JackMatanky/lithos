# Next Steps

## UX Expert Prompt

"Please review the `User Interface Design Goals` section of this PRD. Assess the proposed command structure (`new`, `find`, `index`) for usability, discoverability, and ergonomic efficiency in a terminal environment. Provide feedback on potential ambiguities or areas for improvement in the user's workflow."

## Architect Prompt

"Please review this completed Product Requirements Document. Your task is to create the initial `architecture.md` document for the Lithos MVP. Your design should be guided by the `Technical Assumptions` and must provide a clear, scalable structure for implementing the features defined in the five epics. Pay special attention to defining the core interfaces between the major components (CLI, Template Engine, Indexer, and Validator)."
