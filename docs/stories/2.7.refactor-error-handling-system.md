# Story 2.7: Refactor Error Handling System

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to refactor our error handling system to focus on a clean Result[T] pattern implementation, so that we have a consistent, lean foundation for error handling throughout the application before implementing major architectural changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.7.1: `internal/shared/errors/` package refactored to focus on Result[T] pattern as its core foundation.
2.7.2: Implementation based on reference model from `docs/refs/aidantwoods-go-result-digest.txt`.
2.7.3: Core error types minimized to an absolute minimum set of truly essential types with no bloat.
2.7.4: Domain-specific error types (schema, frontmatter, template) must use correct domain language.
2.7.5: Elimination of unnecessary complexity and fields in the current error handling system.

**Implementation Requirements:**

2.7.6: Clean Result[T] implementation with generic type support, closely following the reference model.
2.7.7: Minimal, focused error types with only essential fields (no bloat).
2.7.8: Support for method chaining (AndThen, Map) with proper type safety.
2.7.9: Clear documentation and examples in README.md with usage patterns for each error type.
2.7.10: Comprehensive unit tests for all Result[T] operations and error types.

**Integration Requirements:**

2.7.11: Complete audit and update of ALL existing uses of the error system.
2.7.12: No backward compatibility - enforce correct usage throughout the codebase.
2.7.13: Explicit verification that domain error types use domain-specific terminology.

- **Reference Implementation**: aidantwoods-go-result-digest.txt (docs/refs/aidantwoods-go-result-digest.txt) - Go Result[T] pattern reference
- **Architectural Context**: This refactoring establishes a clean Result[T] pattern foundation before major architectural changes, ensuring consistent error handling throughout the application.

### Technical Implementation Details

**Result[T] Pattern Implementation:**
- Base implementation on the reference model from `docs/refs/aidantwoods-go-result-digest.txt`
- Focus on clean Result[T] with generic type support
- Implement Ok[T], Err[T], and foundational functions
- Support method chaining (AndThen, Map) with proper type safety

**Error Type Minimization:**
- Create absolute minimum set of base error types (exactly 3):
  1. BaseError: Minimal with only message and cause (no bloat)
  2. ValidationError: Simplified for domain validation errors
  3. ResourceError: For resource operations
- Each error type must have only essential fields
- Eliminate all unnecessary complexity and fields

**Domain-Specific Error Types:**
- Schema validation errors extending ValidationError (using "property" not "field")
- Frontmatter validation errors extending ValidationError (with domain terminology)
- Template error types with proper domain terms
- All domain errors must use correct domain language

**Comprehensive Audit:**
- Audit ALL existing uses of the error system throughout codebase

- Enforce correct implementation (NO backward compatibility)

### Testing

**Unit Testing Requirements:**
- Comprehensive unit tests for all Result[T] operations
- Tests for error wrapping and unwrapping
- Tests for method chaining with complex type flows
- Specific tests for each error type
- Verification of error message formatting and content

**Integration Testing:**
- Test Result[T] pattern usage across multiple components
- Verify error propagation through service layers
- Test error handling in real usage scenarios

**Testing Frameworks:**
- Use existing Go testing framework
- Follow project testing patterns from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md
- Test files should be co-located with implementation files

### Source Tree and Architecture Alignment

**Files to Modify:**
- `internal/shared/errors/result.go`: Refactor to cleaner Result[T] pattern
- `internal/shared/errors/types.go`: Streamline core error types
- `internal/shared/errors/schema.go`: Update to use refactored Result pattern
- `internal/shared/errors/README.md`: Document error handling approach

**Architecture Compliance:**
- Ensure Result[T] implementation follows hexagonal architecture principles
- Keep error handling in shared layer for cross-cutting concerns
- Maintain clean separation between error types and business logic

**Integration Points:**
- All services using error handling must be updated
- Domain models should not contain error logic
- Application services should use Result[T] for error propagation
- **Enhancement Type**: Foundational refactoring to support proper hexagonal architecture
- **Integration Points**: Used by all components that need error handling
- **Goal**: Create a clean, consistent foundation for error handling throughout the application

### Current Error Handling System Analysis

The current error handling in `internal/shared/errors/` has critical issues:

1. **Extreme Bloat**:
   - `BaseError` has 5 attributes (Type, Context, Detail, Value, Cause)
   - Any error type that embeds BaseError automatically inherits this bloat
   - Many fields are unnecessary for most use cases

2. **Incorrect Domain Terminology**:
   - Schema errors incorrectly use "field" terminology instead of "property"
   - Domain-specific error types don't consistently use domain language
   - Lack of alignment between error types and domain models

3. **Too Many Specialized Error Types**:
   - Unnecessary proliferation of error types
   - Inconsistent patterns for similar errors
   - Complex inheritance that obscures essential information

4. **Poor Result[T] Implementation**:
   - Limited support for functional composition
   - Incomplete implementation compared to reference model
   - Lacks clear, enforced usage patterns

### Reference Model

We have a reference document at `docs/refs/aidantwoods-go-result-digest.txt` that describes a clean, well-designed Result[T] pattern implementation with:
- Clear separation between Option[T] and Result[T]
- Functional composition through AndThen and Map
- Clean error handling with unwrapping and pattern matching
- Type-safe generic implementation

### Expected Improvements

This refactoring will:

1. **Extreme Minimalism**:
   - Reduce error types to absolute minimum necessary (3 base types at most)
   - Remove all unnecessary fields from error types
   - Replace the current bloated BaseError with a minimal version (just message and cause)
   - Add a simplified ValidationError as a core type for domain validation errors
   - Each error type should have only essential fields

2. **Domain Correctness**:
   - Ensure all domain errors use correct terminology (properties, not fields)
   - Enforce domain-specific language in error messages and types
   - Align error types with domain model terminology
   - Create clear separation between general and domain-specific errors

3. **Clean Result[T] Implementation**:
   - Implement the full Result[T] pattern based on reference
   - Support comprehensive method chaining
   - Create clear patterns for error handling across the application
   - Enforce correct usage throughout the codebase (no backward compatibility)

4. **Architectural Foundations**:
   - Set the foundation for schema validator architectural refactoring
   - Support proper hexagonal architecture by enabling clean boundaries
   - Enable functional, composable error handling

### Technical Guidance

#### Key Concepts

1. **Result[T]** - A type that represents either success (Ok[T]) or failure (Err[T])
2. **Method Chaining** - Functional composition of operations that may fail
3. **Error Wrapping** - Adding context to errors while preserving the original error
4. **Domain-Specific Errors** - Error types that use domain terminology and concepts

#### Implementation Approach

1. Start with the core Result[T] implementation based on the reference model
2. Implement full method chaining support (AndThen, Map)
3. Create minimal set of base error types (no more than 2-3)
4. Define domain-specific error types with correct terminology
5. Eliminate ALL bloat - each error type should have only essential fields
6. Audit and update ALL uses of errors throughout the codebase

#### Minimal Error Types Design

The new system should have ONLY these error categories:

**Core Error Types (Maximum 3):**
1. **BaseError** - Simple error with just message and cause (no bloat)
2. **ValidationError** - Significantly simplified validation error that can be used by domain validation errors
3. **ResourceError** - For resource operations (simplified from OperationError)

**Domain-Specific Error Types:**
1. **Schema Errors** - Using "property" terminology (NOT "field"), can extend ValidationError
2. **Frontmatter Errors** - Using correct frontmatter terminology, can extend ValidationError
3. **Template Errors** - Using proper template terminology

Each type must be lean with ONLY essential fields - no bloat allowed.

### Definition of Done

- Result[T] pattern implemented based on reference model with full fidelity
- Method chaining (AndThen, Map) completely implemented and tested
- Minimal error types created (no more than 2-3 base types)
- All bloat eliminated - each error type has only essential fields
- Domain-specific error types use correct domain terminology
- ALL existing error uses audited and updated (no exceptions)
- Comprehensive documentation with examples for each error type
- All tests passing with no regressions
- Explicit verification that no bloated error types remain
- Codebase ready for the schema validator architectural refactoring

### Risk Assessment

#### Implementation Risks
- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing error handling
- **Mitigation**: Careful testing and backward compatibility
- **Verification**: Comprehensive test suite

#### Rollback Plan
- Git rollback to previous state
- Incremental implementation with checkpoints
