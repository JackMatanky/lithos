# Story 2.1: Enhance Configuration Management with Config Model

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer, I want to enhance the ConfigViperAdapter with the full Config model, so that all architectural components have access to structured configuration.

## Context Source

- **Source**: Epic 2 - Configuration & Schema Loading
- **Enhancement Type**: Infrastructure improvement for configuration management
- **Integration Points**: ConfigViperAdapter provides configuration to all domain services and adapters
- **Goal**: Establish robust configuration foundation for schema loading and vault operations

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.1.1: The Config model from `docs/architecture/data-models.md#config` is implemented with VaultPath, TemplatesDir, SchemasDir, CacheDir, and LogLevel fields.
2.1.2: ConfigViperAdapter searches for `lithos.yaml` in current directory and parent directories per Viper behavior.
2.1.3: Configuration includes sensible defaults as specified in the data models documentation.
2.1.4: Config validation ensures VaultPath exists and is readable at load time.

**Integration Requirements:**

2.1.5: ConfigPort interface is properly defined and implemented.
2.1.6: Configuration loading follows hexagonal architecture patterns (SPI adapter concern).
2.1.7: All configuration fields are properly typed and validated.

**Quality Requirements:**

2.1.8: Unit tests cover Config model validation and ConfigViperAdapter behavior.
2.1.9: Integration tests verify configuration loading from files and defaults.
2.1.10: Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions.

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: Basic configuration loading exists but lacks full Config model implementation
- **Technology Stack**: Uses github.com/spf13/viper v1.21.0 for configuration management
- **Integration Points**: ConfigViperAdapter provides Config to SchemaRegistry, VaultIndexer, and other services
- **Architecture Pattern**: Follows hexagonal architecture - configuration is SPI adapter concern

### Integration Approach

- **Safe Enhancement**: Build on existing ConfigViperAdapter without breaking current functionality
- **Dependency Injection**: Config is injected into services via ConfigPort interface
- **Validation Strategy**: Validate VaultPath at load time to fail fast on invalid configurations
- **Default Resolution**: Use sensible defaults that work with standard vault directory structure

### Technical Constraints

- **Hexagonal Architecture**: Config model belongs in SPI adapter layer per data-models.md - **CRITICAL**
- **Adapter Location**: Config struct should be in `internal/adapters/spi/config/` directory, not domain
- **Viper Behavior**: Must search upward from current directory for lithos.yaml per tech-stack.md
- **Type Safety**: All configuration fields must be properly typed (no interface{}) per coding-standards.md
- **Startup Loading**: Configuration must be loaded at application startup, not runtime
- **Vault Validation**: VaultPath must exist and be readable at load time per data-models.md

### Key Files to Modify/Create

- `internal/adapters/spi/config/config.go` - **CREATE** - Config struct (SPI adapter model)
- `internal/ports/spi/config.go` - **UPDATE** - ConfigPort interface definition
- `internal/adapters/spi/config/viper_adapter.go` - **UPDATE** - Full Config model implementation
- `internal/adapters/spi/config/viper_adapter_test.go` - **UPDATE** - Unit tests for adapter
- `internal/adapters/spi/config/config_test.go` - **CREATE** - Unit tests for Config struct

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test Config model validation, viper adapter behavior, default value resolution
- **Integration Tests**: Test configuration loading from lithos.yaml files, environment variables
- **Validation Tests**: Test VaultPath existence checking, error handling for invalid configs

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Config model implemented with all required fields and validation
- [ ] ConfigViperAdapter searches for lithos.yaml in directory hierarchy
- [ ] Sensible defaults provided for all configuration fields
- [ ] VaultPath validation ensures vault exists and is readable at load time
- [ ] ConfigPort interface properly defined and implemented
- [ ] Configuration follows hexagonal architecture patterns
- [ ] Unit and integration tests pass with adequate coverage
- [ ] Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Breaking existing configuration loading if viper integration is not handled carefully
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally with existing functionality preserved
- **Verification**: Test existing configuration behavior before and after changes

### Rollback Plan

- **Git Rollback**: Revert to previous commit if configuration loading breaks
- **File Restoration**: Restore previous viper_adapter.go if needed
- **Testing Verification**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Story 1.15 completed architectural cleanup, establishing proper hexagonal architecture separation
- Domain services now properly isolated from infrastructure concerns
- Dependency injection patterns established for service construction

**Data Models:**
- Config model defined in `docs/architecture/data-models.md#config` with required fields: VaultPath, TemplatesDir, SchemasDir, CacheDir, LogLevel
- VaultPath: Root vault directory, must exist and be readable, defaults to current working directory
- TemplatesDir: Template directory path, defaults to `{VaultPath}/templates`
- SchemasDir: Schema directory path, defaults to `{VaultPath}/schemas`
- CacheDir: Cache directory path, defaults to `{VaultPath}/.lithos/cache`
- LogLevel: Logging verbosity level, one of "debug", "info", "warn", "error", defaults to "info"

**API Specifications:**
- ConfigPort interface provides Config() method returning Config struct
- ConfigViperAdapter implements ConfigPort using github.com/spf13/viper
- Viper searches upward from current directory for lithos.yaml configuration file
- Supports environment variable overrides and CLI flag integration

**Component Specifications:**
- ConfigViperAdapter located in `internal/adapters/spi/config/viper_adapter.go`
- Implements SPI adapter pattern for configuration management
- Provides structured configuration to domain services via dependency injection

**File Locations:**
- Config struct: `internal/adapters/spi/config/config.go` (create - SPI adapter model)
- ConfigPort interface: `internal/ports/spi/config.go` (update existing)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of the Config model enhancement. The code follows hexagonal architecture principles perfectly, with the Config struct properly placed in the SPI adapter layer. The viper integration is clean and handles all the required precedence (CLI > ENV > file > defaults). Validation logic is robust with proper error messages. The code is well-documented with clear architecture rationales.

### Refactoring Performed

None required - the implementation is already well-structured and follows all architectural patterns correctly.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: âœ“ Follows all Go 1.23+ standards, proper naming conventions, and hexagonal architecture patterns
- Project Structure: âœ“ Config model correctly placed in internal/adapters/spi/config/, follows source-tree.md
- Testing Strategy: âœ“ Comprehensive unit tests with good coverage, follows testing-strategy.md patterns
- All ACs Met: âœ“ All 10 acceptance criteria are fully implemented and tested

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Code quality is excellent - no improvements needed
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests in tests/integration/ directory for configuration loading scenarios (currently tested in adapter package)
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for configuration loading if needed in high-throughput scenarios

### Security Review

No security concerns. Configuration loading is safe:
- No hardcoded secrets
- Proper validation of vault paths
- Environment variables properly prefixed
- No injection vulnerabilities in YAML parsing

### Performance Considerations

Configuration loading is efficient:
- Validation happens at startup, not runtime
- Viper caching prevents repeated file I/O
- Path resolution is lightweight
- No performance bottlenecks identified

### Files Modified During Review

None - implementation was already complete and correct.
