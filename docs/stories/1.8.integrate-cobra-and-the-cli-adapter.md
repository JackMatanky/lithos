# Story 1.8: Integrate Cobra and the CLI Adapter

## Status

Approved

## Story

As a developer, I want to integrate the Cobra framework into the `cmd/lithos/main.go` entrypoint via a CLI adapter, so that the application has a robust command structure.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 1.8.1: `github.com/spf13/cobra` is added to `go.mod`.
- 1.8.2: A `CobraCLIAdapter` is created in `internal/adapters/api/cli/`.
- 1.8.3: The `main.go` file executes the Cobra adapter.
- 1.8.4: A root `lithos` command and a `version` subcommand are created and functional.
- 1.8.5: Running `lithos version` prints the version string.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Add Cobra dependency to go.mod (AC: 1.8.1)
  - [x] Run `go get github.com/spf13/cobra@v1.9.1`
  - [x] Verify dependency is added correctly
- [x] Task 2: Create CobraCLIAdapter in internal/adapters/api/cli/ (AC: 1.8.2)
  - [x] Create internal/adapters/api/cli/ directory
  - [x] Create cobra_adapter.go file with CobraCLIAdapter struct
  - [x] Implement Execute method that sets up root command and version subcommand
  - [x] Implement registerCommands method to set up command tree
- [x] Task 3: Update main.go to execute the adapter (AC: 1.8.3)
  - [x] Modify cmd/lithos/main.go to instantiate and execute CobraCLIAdapter
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling and exit codes
- [x] Task 4: Test the CLI commands (AC: 1.8.4, 1.8.5)
  - [x] Build the application
  - [x] Test `lithos --help` shows root command
  - [x] Test `lithos version` prints version string
- [x] Task 5: Run tests and verify implementation
  - [x] Execute go test ./internal/adapters/api/cli/
  - [x] Verify all tests pass
  - [x] Run golangci-lint to ensure code standards compliance
- [x] Task 6: Pass pre-commit hooks and commit changes
  - [x] Run pre-commit hooks: golangci-lint run and gitleaks detect
  - [x] Ensure all hooks pass without errors
  - [x] Stage all changed files
  - [x] Create conventional commit message following project standards
  - [x] Commit all changes with the conventional commit message

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 established the hexagonal architecture structure with internal/ directory layout. This story builds on that by adding the first API adapter in internal/adapters/api/cli/, following the established pattern.

### CobraCLIAdapter Specifications

[Source: docs/architecture/components.md#api-adapters]

**Responsibility:** Wire command-line interactions to `CLICommandPort`, translating flags/arguments into domain requests and presenting results.

**Key Interfaces:**

- `Execute(args []string) int`
- `registerCommands(root *cobra.Command)`

**Dependencies:** `CLICommandPort`, `ConfigPort`, `github.com/spf13/cobra`, Logger.

**Technology Stack:** Cobra command tree, `pflag` for flag parsing, structured output helpers (human-readable + JSON), zerolog instrumentation.

### File Locations

[Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

- Adapter: internal/adapters/api/cli/cobra_adapter.go
- Main entry: cmd/lithos/main.go

### Technology Stack

[Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md]

- CLI Framework: github.com/spf13/cobra v1.9.1
- Go version: 1.23+ minimum

### Testing Requirements

[Source: docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md]

- Unit tests for adapter in internal/adapters/api/cli/
- Integration tests for CLI command flows
- Test coverage â‰¥85% for adapter package

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Claude 3.5 Sonnet via OpenCode

### Debug Log References

- Resolved go.mod dependency management issues by properly organizing direct vs indirect dependencies
- Fixed vendoring inconsistencies by removing and regenerating vendor directory
- Addressed linting issues: errcheck for error handling, exhaustruct for struct initialization, golines for line length formatting
- Used -mod=readonly flag to bypass vendoring issues during testing and building

### Completion Notes List

- Successfully integrated Cobra v1.9.1 as direct dependency in go.mod
- Created CobraCLIAdapter following hexagonal architecture patterns in internal/adapters/api/cli/
- Implemented Execute method with proper error handling and exit codes
- Set up root lithos command with version subcommand printing "Lithos version 0.1.0"
- Updated main.go to instantiate and execute the adapter
- Created comprehensive unit tests covering all CLI operations (version, help, invalid commands, no args)
- All tests pass with proper coverage and error handling
- Code passes golangci-lint with no blocking issues
- CLI commands work correctly: `lithos --help` shows command structure, `lithos version` prints version

### File List

- `go.mod` - Added github.com/spf13/cobra v1.9.1 as direct dependency
- `cmd/lithos/main.go` - Updated to use CobraCLIAdapter with proper error handling
- `internal/adapters/api/cli/cobra_adapter.go` - New CobraCLIAdapter implementation
- `internal/adapters/api/cli/cobra_adapter_test.go` - Comprehensive unit tests
