# Story 2.3: Implement Property Domain Models

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement the Property models and PropertySpec from the architecture, so that I have robust property definitions.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.3.1: Property model with Name, Required, Array, and Spec fields is implemented following the architecture specification.
2.3.2: PropertySpec interface and concrete implementations (StringPropertySpec, NumberPropertySpec, DatePropertySpec, FilePropertySpec, BoolPropertySpec) are created.
2.3.3: PropertyBank model with Properties map and Location field is implemented for reusable property definitions.
2.3.4: All property models include unit tests for validation and behavior.

**Integration Requirements:**

2.3.5: Property models integrate with Schema model for validation rules.
2.3.6: PropertySpec implementations expose validation behavior only; adapters handle JSON/YAML parsing before constructing specs.
2.3.7: PropertyBank exposes registry constructs for adapters; file parsing and $ref resolution stay within SchemaLoader.

**Quality Requirements:**

2.3.8: Unit tests cover Property model validation and PropertySpec polymorphism.
2.3.9: Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions.
2.3.10: Property models include proper error handling for invalid configurations.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement Property domain model (AC: 2.3.1, 2.3.5)
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/property.go` with Property struct containing:
    - Name (string) - Property identifier matching frontmatter key
    - Required (boolean) - Whether property must be present in frontmatter
    - Array (boolean) - Whether property accepts multiple values (YAML list)
    - Spec (PropertySpec interface) - Type-specific validation configuration

  - [x] Add NewProperty constructor/helpers with validation of field constraints
  - [x] Ensure integration with Schema model for validation rules composition
  - [x] Keep domain model serialization-free; provide constructors for adapter use
  - [x] **File Splitting**: Split monolithic property.go into focused files for SRP:
    - `property_types.go` - Core types, interfaces, Property struct, constructors, helpers
    - `property_specs.go` - All PropertySpec implementations and Validate methods
    - `property_validation.go` - Validation helper functions shared across specs

  - [x] Document constructor requirements for SchemaLoader adapter integration
  - [x] Ensure all PropertySpec types can be instantiated via domain constructors after adapter JSON parsing

- [x] Task 3: Implement PropertyBank model (AC: 2.3.3, 2.3.7)
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/property_bank.go` with PropertyBank struct containing:
    - Properties (map[string]Property) - Named property definitions by unique identifier
    - Location (string) - Path to property bank directory (default: schemas/properties/)
  - [x] Implement NewPropertyBank constructor with location validation
  - [x] Add RegisterProperty method for adding reusable property definitions
  - [x] Document $ref resolution strategy for SchemaLoader adapter implementation
  - [x] Ensure thread-safe access patterns for SchemaRegistry concurrent usage
  - [x] Keep PropertyBank as domain registry without file parsing logic

- [x] Task 4: Add comprehensive testing (AC: 2.3.4, 2.3.8, 2.3.9, 2.3.10)
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/property_test.go` with table-driven unit tests for Property model
  - [x] Test Property constructor validation and field constraint enforcement
  - [x] Add tests for all PropertySpec implementations using table-driven test patterns:
    - StringPropertySpec: enum validation, pattern matching, edge cases
    - NumberPropertySpec: min/max bounds, step validation, integer detection
    - DatePropertySpec: format parsing with various Go time layouts
    - FilePropertySpec: fileClass filtering, directory constraints
    - BoolPropertySpec: type checking and error cases
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/property_bank_test.go` with PropertyBank registry tests
  - [x] Test domain constructors without JSON serialization dependencies
  - [x] Add error condition tests for invalid property definitions (e.g., conflicting overrides, missing spec)
  - [x] Ensure â‰¥85% coverage for domain models per testing-strategy.md standards
  - [x] Add integration tests for adapter-domain boundary via contract tests

## Dev Notes

### Context Source

- **Source**: Epic 2 - Configuration & Schema Loading
- **Enhancement Type**: Domain model implementation for property validation system
- **Integration Points**: Property models used by Schema for validation rules and PropertyBank for reusable definitions
- **Goal**: Establish core domain models for schema property validation

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: Basic domain models exist but Property models not yet implemented
- **Technology Stack**: Go 1.23+ with stdlib JSON for serialization
- **Integration Points**: Property models used by Schema for validation and PropertyBank for reusable definitions
- **Architecture Pattern**: Domain Core models following hexagonal architecture

### Integration Approach

- **Safe Implementation**: Create new domain models without affecting existing functionality
- **Polymorphism Support**: PropertySpec interface enables type-specific validation
- **JSON Compatibility**: Ensure models can be unmarshaled from JSON schema files
- **Reference Resolution**: PropertyBank supports $ref for reusable property definitions

### Technical Constraints

- **Domain Core**: Property models belong in `internal/domain/` as pure business logic
- **Interface Polymorphism**: PropertySpec interface with concrete implementations for each type
- **JSON Serialization**: Use Go stdlib JSON with proper struct tags and custom unmarshaling
- **Type Safety**: All fields properly typed, no interface{} overuse

### Key Files to Modify/Create

- `internal/domain/property.go` - **CREATE** - Property model and PropertySpec implementations
- `internal/domain/property_bank.go` - **CREATE** - PropertyBank model
- `internal/domain/property_test.go` - **CREATE** - Unit tests for Property models

### Risk Assessment

#### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Complex PropertySpec polymorphism may introduce validation bugs
- **Mitigation**: Implement incrementally with comprehensive unit tests
- **Verification**: Test each PropertySpec type thoroughly before integration
- **Performance Risk**: PropertySpec validation could become bottleneck in large vaults
- **Mitigation**: Use efficient stdlib validation (regexp.Compile once, reuse compiled patterns)
- **Concurrency Risk**: PropertyBank registry accessed by multiple goroutines
- **Mitigation**: Design for thread-safe access patterns required by SchemaRegistry

#### Rollback Plan

- **Git Rollback**: Revert to previous commit if PropertySpec validation fails
- **File Removal**: Delete new property files if integration issues arise
- **Testing Verification**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

#### Performance Considerations

- **PropertySpec Validation**: Critical path for vault indexing performance (PRD target: <300ms render)
- **Regex Compilation**: Compile StringPropertySpec patterns once during schema loading, reuse during validation
- **Memory Allocation**: Minimize allocations in Validate methods to reduce GC pressure during batch validation
- **Concurrent Access**: PropertyBank registry must support concurrent reads by SchemaRegistry domain service
- **JSON Unmarshaling**: Use efficient stdlib patterns for PropertySpec discriminator unmarshaling

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 2.2 will implement Schema model providing foundation for property validation
- This story builds on domain model patterns established in Epic 1 (File, Frontmatter, Note models)
- Hexagonal architecture patterns established in Story 1.14/1.15 provide guidance for domain model placement

### Data Models

- Property model defined in `docs/architecture/data-models.md#property` with required fields: Name, Required, Array, Spec
- PropertySpec interface with Validate(value interface{}) error method for polymorphic validation
- Five concrete PropertySpec implementations: StringPropertySpec, NumberPropertySpec, DatePropertySpec, FilePropertySpec, BoolPropertySpec
- PropertyBank model defined in `docs/architecture/data-models.md#propertybank` with Properties map[string]Property and Location string field
- SchemaLoader adapter performs JSON discriminator handling to determine PropertySpec concrete types before invoking domain constructors.
- $ref resolution pattern for reusable property definitions across schemas

### API Specifications

- Property models are pure domain core, no direct API exposure
- Used by Schema model for validation rules and PropertyBank for reusable definitions
- PropertySpec interface enables polymorphic validation by SchemaValidator domain service
- Integration with SchemaRegistry for property bank loading and reference resolution
- Used by SchemaLoaderPort adapter after it parses JSON schema files into DTOs

### Component Specifications

- Property models located in `internal/domain/property.go` per source-tree.md
- PropertyBank model in `internal/domain/property_bank.go` per architecture design
- Follows hexagonal architecture: pure domain core with no infrastructure dependencies
- Delegates JSON serialization to adapters per tech-stack.md guidance
- PropertySpec interface enables polymorphic validation by SchemaValidator domain service
- PropertyBank provides reusable property registry for SchemaRegistry domain service

### File Locations

- Property model: `internal/domain/property.go` (create new)
- PropertyBank model: `internal/domain/property_bank.go` (create new)
- Tests: `internal/domain/property_test.go` and `internal/domain/property_bank_test.go` (create new)

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests for Property model field validation and PropertySpec polymorphism
- Unit tests for all PropertySpec implementations and type-specific validation
- Unit tests for PropertyBank loading and $ref resolution
- Integration tests ensuring adapter-populated domain objects validate correctly

### Technical Constraints

- Follow domain core principles: pure business logic, no infrastructure dependencies per components.md
- Keep domain models serialization-agnostic; SchemaLoader adapter uses Go stdlib `encoding/json` per tech-stack.md when hydrating DTOs
- Implement PropertySpec as interface with concrete implementations for polymorphic validation
- Support $ref resolution in PropertyBank for reusable properties per data-models.md
- Follow coding-standards.md: Go 1.23+ features, Result pattern for error handling if crossing boundaries
- Ensure thread-safe design for use by SchemaRegistry domain service with concurrent access

#### Testing Standards

- Follow testing patterns from `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`
- Unit tests co-located with implementation files
- Use table-driven tests for multiple validation scenarios
- Test both success and failure cases
- Target â‰¥85% coverage for `internal/app` domain services (per testing-strategy.md)
- Target â‰¥70% overall coverage for new domain models

## QA Results

### Pre-Implementation Review

**Status**: Story needs clarification and task completion before implementation

**Key Issues Identified:**
- Tasks need to be completed sequentially before story can be approved
- Architecture boundary between domain and adapter needs clarification for PropertySpec handling
- Dependency on Story 2.2 (Schema domain model) completion required

**Recommendations:**
- Complete Task 1-4 sequentially with proper domain-adapter boundary
- Ensure PropertySpec constructors support adapter integration without domain JSON parsing
- Verify integration with Schema model from Story 2.2 before proceeding

### Review Date: 2025-10-21

- **Decision:** PASS (Recommend status progression to Ready for Done once the story is formally moved into "Review" state.)
- **Scope Reviewed:** `internal/domain/property.go`, `property_specs.go`, `property_bank.go`, associated *_test.go files, and `internal/adapters/spi/property/serializer.go` + tests.
- **Tests Executed:** `go test ./...`

**Requirements Traceability**
- AC 2.3.1 & 2.3.5 â€“ Property core model validates identifiers/specs and exposes `ValidateValue`; Schema validation continues to consume these invariants via `Schema.Validate` tests.
- AC 2.3.2, 2.3.6 â€“ PropertySpec variants encapsulate validation only; JSON concerns moved into adapter serializer with round-trip tests.
- AC 2.3.3 & 2.3.7 â€“ PropertyBank holds reusable definitions with mutex-protected registry; concurrency and name validation covered in tests.
- AC 2.3.4, 2.3.8â€“2.3.10 â€“ Table-driven unit suites exercise happy/edge/error paths for specs, properties, and bank behaviors, returning structured `ValidationError`s.

**Risk & NFR Summary**
- Security: PASS â€“ Pure domain logic; no new IO or trust boundaries introduced.
- Performance: PASS â€“ Validation helpers remain O(n) over value slices; no additional allocations beyond map copies in serializer.
- Reliability: PASS â€“ Mutex usage in PropertyBank validated under concurrent registration.
- Maintainability: PASS â€“ Domain/adapters separation clarified; minor helper duplication noted but non-blocking.

**Observations & Recommendations**
- Update story status from "Ready for Review" to "Review" prior to final hand-off to keep workflow checks aligned with QA prerequisites.
- Consider consolidating duplicate serializer helper functions (`decode*`/`extract*`) to reduce confusion between method and package-level variants.
