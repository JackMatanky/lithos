# Story 1.14: Refactor Template Operations to Follow Hexagonal Architecture

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to refactor template operations from the CLI layer into proper domain services, so that the application follows hexagonal architecture principles and template logic is properly separated from user interface concerns.

## Context Source

- **Source**: Brownfield refactoring of working Story 1.13 implementation
- **Problem**: Current implementation has template parsing, rendering, and file operations directly in CLI layer (`internal/adapters/api/cli/new.go`), violating hexagonal architecture
- **Impact**: Template functionality will expand significantly in Epic 4-5, making this architectural debt problematic
- **Goal**: Separate concerns into domain services while maintaining existing functionality

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **TemplateEngine Domain Service**: Create `internal/app/template/TemplateEngine` that handles template parsing and rendering logic
2. **TemplateRepositoryPort Interface**: Define `internal/ports/spi/TemplateRepositoryPort` for template file operations
3. **TemplateFSAdapter SPI**: Implement `internal/adapters/spi/template/TemplateFSAdapter` that satisfies TemplateRepositoryPort
4. **CLI Refactoring**: Refactor `internal/adapters/api/cli/new.go` to use domain services instead of direct template operations
5. **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `lithos new <template-path>` command continues to work exactly as before

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Dependency Injection**: TemplateEngine and TemplateRepositoryPort are properly injected into CLI command
7. **Error Handling**: Template-related errors continue to propagate correctly through architectural layers
8. **Function Map**: Custom template functions (`now`, `toLower`, `toUpper`) remain available
9. **File Operations**: Template reading and output writing use proper ports/adapters

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **Unit Tests**: Add comprehensive unit tests for TemplateEngine, TemplateRepositoryPort, and TemplateFSAdapter
11. **Integration Tests**: Update existing integration tests to work with new architecture
12. **No Regressions**: All existing tests pass, no functional changes to user experience
13. **Code Coverage**: Maintain or improve test coverage for refactored components

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current Implementation**: Template parsing/rendering in `internal/adapters/api/cli/new.go`
- **Working Features**: Static template parsing, custom functions, file reading/writing
- **Architecture Violation**: CLI layer contains domain logic instead of delegating to domain services

### Integration Approach

- **TemplateEngine**: Extract parsing/rendering logic from CLI into domain service
- **TemplateRepositoryPort**: Define interface for template file operations (read template files)
- **TemplateFSAdapter**: Implement SPI adapter using existing FileSystemPort/LocalFileSystemAdapter
- **CLI Changes**: Replace direct template operations with calls to injected domain services

### Technical Constraints

- **No Breaking Changes**: `lithos new` command interface remains identical
- **Function Compatibility**: All existing template functions must work
- **Error Messages**: Preserve existing error handling and user feedback
- **Performance**: No degradation in template processing speed

### Key Files to Modify

- `internal/adapters/api/cli/new.go` - Refactor to use domain services
- `internal/app/template/` - Domain services (parser.go, executor.go, functions.go) - already exist
- `internal/ports/spi/template.go` - Port interface - already exists
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/` - **CRITICAL**: Remove misplaced domain files (executor.go, functions.go, parser.go) from SPI layer
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/template_fs_adapter.go` - SPI adapter - already exists

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Refactoring could introduce subtle bugs in template processing
- **Mitigation**: Comprehensive testing, small incremental changes, preserve existing behavior
- **Verification**: All existing tests pass, manual testing of `lithos new` command

### Rollback Plan

- **Simple Rollback**: Revert changes to `internal/adapters/api/cli/new.go` to restore direct template operations
- **Backup**: Keep working version of Story 1.13 implementation available during refactoring

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test TemplateEngine parsing/rendering, TemplateFSAdapter file operations
- **Integration Tests**: Verify end-to-end `lithos new` command still works
- **Regression Tests**: Ensure no existing functionality breaks

### Testing Standards

- Follow existing test patterns from `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`
- Unit tests in `*_test.go` files alongside implementation
- Integration tests in `tests/integration/` directory
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test error conditions and edge cases

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Context:**
- Story 1.13 implemented working template file writing functionality
- Template parsing/rendering was done directly in CLI for MVP speed
- Architecture identified this as technical debt during implementation

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Follows hexagonal architecture: domain services, ports, adapters
- Uses existing FileSystemPort patterns for consistency
- Maintains separation between API, domain, and SPI layers

**Integration Points:**
- Uses existing LocalFileSystemAdapter for file operations
- Integrates with shared error handling and logging packages
- Follows dependency injection patterns established in earlier stories
