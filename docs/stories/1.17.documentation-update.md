## Dev Notes

### QA Test Design Reference

**Test Design Document:** `docs/qa/assessments/1.17-test-design-20251028.md`

This story incorporates all 18 test scenarios identified in the QA test design:

- 8 unit tests, 6 integration tests, 4 e2e tests covering documentation updates and verification
- 3 P0 priority scenarios for critical documentation functionality, 14 P1 for standard features, 1 P2 for edge cases
- Test coverage ensures proper documentation updates, CLI functionality, and quality gates

**Note:** The detailed test scenarios in AC1.17.3-1.17.5 and Tasks 1-8 are derived from this QA analysis.

### README Template Structure

**Installation Section:**

````markdown
## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.23 or later (required for generics support)

### Install via go install

```bash
go install github.com/JackMatanky/lithos@latest
```
````

This will install the `lithos` binary to your `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

````

**Quick Start Section:**

```markdown
## Quick Start

1. **Create or navigate to your vault directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir my-vault
   cd my-vault
````

2. **Create configuration file (optional):**
   Create `lithos.json` in vault root:

   ```json
   {
     "vaultPath": ".",
     "templatesDir": "templates/",
     "logLevel": "info"
   }
   ```

   If omitted, lithos uses sensible defaults.

3. **Create templates directory:**

   ```bash
   mkdir templates
   ```

4. **Create your first template:**
   Create `templates/contact.md`:

   ```markdown
   ---
   title: { { prompt "name" "Contact Name" "" } }
   created: { { now "2006-01-02" } }
   ---

   # {{ prompt "name" "Contact Name" "" }}

   Email: {{ prompt "email" "Email Address" "" }}
   Phone: {{ prompt "phone" "Phone Number" "" }}
   ```

5. **Generate a note from the template:**

   ```bash
   lithos new contact
   ```

6. **Check the generated note:**
   The note will be created in your vault root with the rendered content.

````
