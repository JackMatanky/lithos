# Story 3.18: Documentation Update for Vault Indexing Engine Release

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a maintainer,
I want to update all project documentation to reflect the completed vault indexing engine implementation,
So that users and developers have accurate, comprehensive documentation for the new vault indexing capabilities.

## Context

This story finalizes Epic 3 (Vault Indexing Engine) by ensuring all documentation accurately reflects the implemented vault indexing functionality. It follows the same pattern as story 1.17 for the foundational CLI release.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Updates Required

1. **README.md**: Update main README with vault indexing features and CLI commands
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Update docs/architecture.md with vault indexing engine details
3. **API Documentation**: Document any new CLI commands and their usage
4. **Code Comments**: Ensure all vault indexing code has appropriate documentation
5. **Change Log**: Update CHANGELOG.md with Epic 3 completion details
6. **User Guide**: Update any user-facing documentation with vault indexing instructions

### Content Accuracy Requirements

7. All technical details match the implemented vault indexing components
8. CLI command examples work with the actual implementation
9. Architecture diagrams (if any) reflect the actual system design
10. Performance characteristics and limitations are documented
11. Error messages and troubleshooting guidance is included

### Quality Requirements

12. Documentation follows project style guidelines
13. All links and references are working
14. Documentation is clear and accessible to target audience
15. No outdated information remains from previous versions

## Dev Notes
