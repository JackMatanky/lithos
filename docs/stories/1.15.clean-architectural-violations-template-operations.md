# Story 1.15: Clean Architectural Violations in Template Operations

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to remove misplaced domain logic from the SPI adapter layer, so that the application properly follows hexagonal architecture principles with clear separation between domain services and infrastructure adapters.

## Context Source

- **Source**: Post-implementation review of Story 1.14
- **Problem**: Domain logic files (executor.go, functions.go, parser.go) exist in `internal/adapters/spi/template/` alongside the legitimate SPI adapter (template_fs_adapter.go)
- **Impact**: Violates hexagonal architecture - domain services should only be in `internal/app/`, SPI adapters should only contain infrastructure implementations
- **Goal**: Clean separation of concerns with domain logic exclusively in domain layer

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Domain Files Removed**: Remove `executor.go`, `functions.go`, `parser.go` from `internal/adapters/spi/template/`
2. **SPI Layer Cleaned**: Only `template_fs_adapter.go` and its test remain in SPI template directory
3. **Domain Layer Intact**: All domain services remain properly located in `internal/app/template/`
4. **No Import Breaks**: Update any code that incorrectly imports from SPI template package
5. **Existing Functionality Preserved**: `lithos new` command continues to work exactly as before

**Integration Requirements:**

6. **Clean Architecture**: Domain layer (`internal/app/`) contains only business logic
7. **SPI Adapters**: `internal/adapters/spi/` contains only infrastructure implementations
8. **Dependency Integrity**: All existing dependencies and imports remain functional
9. **Test Coverage Maintained**: No test coverage lost due to file removal

**Quality Requirements:**

10. **No Regressions**: All existing tests pass after cleanup
11. **Code Standards**: Removal follows project cleanup standards
12. **Documentation Updated**: Any references to removed files updated
13. **Git History Clean**: Changes committed with clear conventional commit message

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: Template domain logic duplicated between `internal/app/template/` and `internal/adapters/spi/template/`
- **Correct Location**: Domain services belong in `internal/app/template/` (business logic layer)
- **SPI Purpose**: `internal/adapters/spi/template/` should only contain infrastructure adapters
- **Impact**: This cleanup ensures proper architectural boundaries

### Integration Approach

- **Safe Removal**: Domain files in SPI layer are duplicates - correct implementations exist in domain layer
- **Import Audit**: Check for any incorrect imports from `internal/adapters/spi/template/` package
- **Dependency Check**: Ensure no legitimate dependencies on removed files
- **Gradual Cleanup**: Remove files one by one with testing after each removal

### Technical Constraints

- **No Functional Changes**: This is pure architectural cleanup, no behavior changes
- **Preserve Tests**: Keep test files that are legitimately testing SPI adapters
- **Import Updates**: Fix any imports that referenced domain logic from SPI package
- **Zero Downtime**: Application functionality must remain intact

### Key Files to Modify

- `internal/adapters/spi/template/executor.go` - **REMOVE** (domain logic)
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/functions.go` - **REMOVE** (domain logic)
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/parser.go` - **REMOVE** (domain logic)
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/template_fs_adapter.go` - **KEEP** (legitimate SPI adapter)
- `internal/adapters/spi/template/template_fs_adapter_test.go` - **KEEP** (tests SPI adapter)
- Any files importing from SPI template package - **UPDATE** imports if needed

### Testing Strategy

### Testing Strategy

- **Pre-removal Testing**: Run full test suite before any file removal
- **Incremental Removal**: Remove one file at a time, run tests after each
- **Post-cleanup Testing**: Full test suite after all removals complete
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure no functionality breaks due to import issues

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Domain logic completely removed from SPI adapter layer
- [ ] Only legitimate infrastructure adapters remain in `internal/adapters/spi/template/`
- [ ] All imports updated to reference correct packages
- [ ] Full test suite passes with no regressions
- [ ] Application functionality preserved exactly
- [ ] Clean architectural separation maintained
- [ ] Changes committed with proper documentation

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Import errors if files reference removed domain logic from SPI package
- **Mitigation**: Incremental removal with testing, audit all imports before removal
- **Verification**: Test after each file removal and import fix

### Rollback Plan

- **Git Rollback**: Revert commit if issues discovered
- **File Restoration**: Restore removed files from git if needed
- **Import Reversion**: Revert import changes if domain services unavailable

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Context:**
- Story 1.14 implemented template refactoring but left architectural violations
- Domain logic was duplicated between domain and SPI layers
- Cleanup identified post-implementation review

**Architecture Alignment:**
- Follows hexagonal architecture: domain in `internal/app/`, infrastructure in `internal/adapters/spi/`
- Maintains clean separation of business logic from infrastructure concerns
- Ensures SPI adapters contain only infrastructure implementations

**Integration Points:**
- Domain services in `internal/app/template/` remain unchanged
- SPI adapter `template_fs_adapter.go` continues to work with domain services
- CLI integration unchanged - still uses domain services correctly

**Source References:**
- [Architecture: docs/architecture/components.md#domain-services]
- [Architecture: docs/architecture/components.md#spi-adapters]
- [Architecture: docs/architecture/high-level-architecture.md#hexagonal-architecture]

## Testing

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Verify SPI adapter tests still pass after cleanup
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure end-to-end template functionality works
- **Regression Tests**: Full test suite to catch any missed dependencies

### Testing Standards

- Follow existing test patterns from `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md`
- Tests remain in appropriate locations alongside implementation
- Maintain test coverage for remaining SPI adapter

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-10-20

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent Architecture Achievement**: The cleanup successfully removed domain logic violations and established proper hexagonal architecture separation. The SPI adapter now correctly uses dependency injection and contains only infrastructure implementations. Domain services are properly isolated in the application layer.

### Refactoring Performed

**No refactoring needed** - The implementation correctly follows hexagonal architecture principles with clean separation of concerns.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✅ **PASS** - Code follows project standards and naming conventions
- Project Structure: ✅ **PASS** - Domain services in `internal/app/`, SPI adapters in `internal/adapters/spi/`
- Testing Strategy: ✅ **PASS** - Comprehensive test coverage maintained with appropriate test levels
- All ACs Met: ✅ **PASS** - All 13 acceptance criteria fully satisfied

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] **Architecture Cleanup Completed**: Domain logic successfully removed from SPI layer
- [x] **Dependency Injection Implemented**: TemplateFSAdapter properly accepts parser dependency
- [x] **Import Updates Verified**: All incorrect imports updated to reference domain services
- [x] **Test Coverage Maintained**: No test coverage lost, all tests passing
- [x] **Clean Separation Achieved**: Domain contains business logic, SPI contains infrastructure

### Security Review

**No Security Concerns**: This architectural cleanup does not introduce security issues. The changes maintain existing security boundaries and do not expose new attack surfaces.

### Performance Considerations

**Performance Maintained**: The refactoring uses dependency injection which may actually improve performance by enabling better testability and future optimizations. No performance degradation detected.

### Files Modified During Review

**No files modified during review** - The implementation was already correct and complete.

### Recommended Status

[✓ Ready for Done] / [✗ Changes Required - See unchecked items above]
(Story owner decides final status)

### Post-Implementation Quality Improvements

**Naming Convention Refinement (Completed):**
- [x] Renamed `TemplateFSAdapter` → `FSAdapter` in `internal/adapters/spi/template/fs_adapter.go` (eliminates package name repetition)
- [x] Kept `TemplateEngine` type name in `internal/app/template/service.go` (deliberate exception - primary service access point)
- [x] Updated all references across codebase (tests, main.go, integration tests, CLI adapters)
- [x] Renamed files: `template_fs_adapter.go` → `fs_adapter.go`, `template_engine.go` → `service.go`
- **Rationale**: `FSAdapter` improves standards compliance; `TemplateEngine` retained for semantic clarity as main service entry point
- **Standards Exception**: `TemplateEngine` in package `template` is accepted exception per semantic importance
- **Impact**: Pure refactoring, no functional changes, all tests pass
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** - All tests pass, refactoring successful
