# Story 3.5: VaultIndexer Service

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** VaultIndexer to orchestrate the indexing workflow,
**so that** the cache and in-memory indices stay consistent with the vault.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `internal/app/vault/indexer.go` implements `Indexer.Build` following the steps in `docs/architecture/components.md#vaultindexer` (vault scan → note creation → cache persist) and respects FR9.

2. `IndexStats` records counts for scanned notes, indexed notes, cache failures, and total duration; logging uses zerolog per coding standards and feeds NFR3 metrics.

3. Indexer handles cache write failures by logging warnings without aborting the build.

4. Basic file scanning creates Note objects with file metadata (path, size, modification time) for indexing foundation.

5. Indexer focuses solely on vault structure and file discovery, delegating content processing to specialized services.

6. IndexStats tracks scanning metrics (files found, processing time) for performance monitoring.

7. Unit tests with fakes verify call order, error handling for cache operations, stats accuracy, and file scanning logic.

8. `golangci-lint run ./internal/app/vault` and `go test ./internal/app/vault` succeed.

## Dev Notes

### VaultIndexer Workflow

From `docs/architecture/components.md#vaultindexer` (v0.6.8):

**Purpose:** Orchestrates vault indexing from scan to cache persistence.

**Build() Workflow (3 steps):**

```go
func (v *VaultIndexer) Build(ctx context.Context) (IndexStats, error) {
     stats := IndexStats{StartTime: time.Now()}

     // Step 1: Scan vault
     vaultFiles, err := v.vaultReader.ScanAll(ctx)
     if err != nil {
         return stats, fmt.Errorf("vault scan failed: %w", err)
     }
     stats.ScannedCount = len(vaultFiles)

     // Step 2: For each file, create basic note
     for _, vf := range vaultFiles {
         // Filter: only .md files for MVP
         if vf.Ext != ".md" {
             continue
         }

         // Create basic Note with file metadata
         noteID := deriveNoteIDFromPath(vf.Path)
         note := domain.NewNote(noteID, vf.Path, vf.Size, vf.ModTime)

         // Step 3: Persist to cache
         if err := v.cacheWriter.Persist(ctx, note); err != nil {
             stats.CacheFailures++
             v.log.Warn().Err(err).Str("noteID", noteID.String()).Msg("cache persist failed")
             // Continue - don't abort indexing
         }

         stats.IndexedCount++
     }

     stats.Duration = time.Since(stats.StartTime)

     // Log summary
     v.log.Info().
         Int("scanned", stats.ScannedCount).
         Int("indexed", stats.IndexedCount).
         Int("cache_failures", stats.CacheFailures).
         Dur("duration", stats.Duration).
         Msg("vault indexing complete")

     return stats, nil
}
```

**Key Design Decisions:**

**Focused Service (NOT God Service):**

- VaultIndexer orchestrates workflow only
- Does NOT implement scanning, caching, or indexing
- Delegates to injected dependencies

**Resilient Error Handling:**

- Cache failures: Log warning, continue processing
- Vault scan failures: Return error immediately
- Partial success is acceptable - index what we can

### IndexStats Structure

```go
type IndexStats struct {
     ScannedCount       int           // Total files scanned
     IndexedCount       int           // Notes successfully indexed
     CacheFailures      int           // Cache persistence errors
     Duration           time.Duration // Total indexing time
}
```

**NFR3 Metrics:**

- Stats feed performance monitoring
- Duration tracks indexing speed (<300ms target for small vaults)
- Cache failure counts track persistence issues

### Dependencies

From `docs/architecture/components.md#vaultindexer`:

**Injected Dependencies:**

- VaultReaderPort - scan vault files
- CacheWriterPort - persist notes to cache
- Logger - structured logging
- Config - vault path, cache dir

**Constructor:**

```go
func NewVaultIndexer(
     vaultReader VaultReaderPort,
     cacheWriter CacheWriterPort,
     config Config,
     log zerolog.Logger,
) *VaultIndexer
```

### NoteID Derivation

**Adapter Responsibility:**
VaultIndexer calls helper function to derive NoteID from file path:

```go
func deriveNoteIDFromPath(path string) NoteID {
     // For MVP: Use relative path from vault root
     // Example: "/vault/projects/foo.md" → "projects/foo"
     // Adapter-level translation: Path → NoteID
     basename := filepath.Base(path)
     name := strings.TrimSuffix(basename, filepath.Ext(basename))
     return domain.NewNoteID(name)
}
```

**Future:** May use UUID or content hash for NoteID

### File Locations

**Implementation:**

- `internal/app/vault/indexer.go` - VaultIndexer service
- `internal/app/vault/indexer_test.go` - Unit tests with fakes

**Dependencies:**

- `internal/ports/spi/vault.go` - VaultReaderPort
- `internal/ports/spi/cache.go` - CacheWriterPort
- `internal/domain/note.go` - Note, NoteID models

### Testing Standards

**Unit Tests with Fakes:**

- FakeVaultReaderPort: Return predefined VaultFile list
- FakeCacheWriterPort: Track Persist() calls, optionally fail

**Test Scenarios:**

- Happy path: All steps succeed, verify stats accuracy
- Cache failures: Some cache writes fail, indexing continues
- Verify call order: VaultReader → CacheWriter
- Verify logging: Check warning logs for failures

### Refactoring Guidelines

**SRP Decomposition Examples:**

For this story (VaultIndexer), functions should be decomposed into focused helpers following SRP:

**Build() Decomposition:**

- `scanFiles()` - Call VaultReaderPort.ScanAll() and return files (responsibility: vault scanning)
- `processFile(vf VaultFile) (Note, error)` - Create basic note from file metadata (responsibility: single file processing)
- `persistNote(note Note)` - Call cacheWriter.Persist() to persist note (responsibility: cache persistence)
- `trackChanges(stats *IndexStats, event string)` - Increment appropriate stat counter (responsibility: stats tracking)
- Build() orchestrates these helpers for clean separation

**When to Decompose:**

- If any method exceeds 15 lines, consider extraction
- If a method has >2 concerns, extract helpers (e.g., Build does scan, process, persist → extract each)
- Extract file processing loop body into processFile() for clarity
- Separate error handling logic (handleError, shouldAbort, logWarning)
- VaultIndexer orchestrates workflow, delegates to injected dependencies

**Naming Standards:**

- Exported types: PascalCase (VaultIndexer, IndexStats)
- Constructors: NewTypeName (NewVaultIndexer)
- Private helpers: camelCase (scanFiles, processFile, updateIndex, trackChanges, handleError, shouldAbort, logWarning)
- Methods: PascalCase for exported (Build), camelCase for private
- Stat helpers: formatStats, logStats (clear stat-related naming)

**Documentation Requirements:**

- Package comment at top of indexer.go explaining VaultIndexer purpose and resilient design
- All exported types and methods have GoDoc comments
- Private helpers have GoDoc or inline comments explaining purpose
- Document complete workflow steps (Build: 3 steps documented)
- Document error handling strategy (resilient, partial success acceptable)
- Document which errors abort vs continue (vault scan aborts, cache continue)
- Document stats fields and NFR3 metrics integration

**Error Handling Patterns:**

- Vault scan failure: Return error immediately, abort indexing
- Cache write failure: Log warning, increment CacheFailures, continue processing
- Partial success is acceptable - index what we can
- Structured logging: Info for progress, Warn for failures (non-fatal), Error for fatal errors

### Review Date: 2025-10-31 (Additional Review - Refresh Method)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Excellent implementation quality maintained** - The Refresh method follows identical patterns to Build(), with proper incremental scanning, error handling, and logging. Additional functionality is well-integrated without compromising existing code quality.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - Refresh method implementation follows established patterns perfectly.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Full compliance with Go conventions and project standards
- Project Structure: ✓ Files located correctly in `internal/app/vault/`
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Additional unit tests with fakes, coverage now 97.4%
- All ACs Met: ✓ Original ACs 1-8 fully implemented, Refresh is additional bonus functionality

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refresh method properly tested with comprehensive scenarios
- [x] Incremental scanning implemented correctly
- [x] Error handling consistent with Build method
- [x] Logging appropriate for incremental operations

### Security Review

**PASS** - No additional security concerns introduced. Refresh method uses same secure patterns as Build.

### Performance Considerations

**PASS** - Refresh optimizes performance for large vaults by processing only modified files since timestamp. Suitable for incremental updates.

### Files Modified During Review

None - Refresh implementation quality was already excellent.

### Gate Status

Gate: PASS → docs/qa/gates/3.5.vault-indexer-service.yml
Risk profile: docs/qa/assessments/3.5-risk-20251031.md

### Recommended Status

✓ Ready for Done
(Story owner decides final status)

### Additional Notes on Refresh Method

The Refresh method represents additional functionality beyond the original story acceptance criteria. It implements incremental indexing for large vault optimization, processing only files modified since a specified timestamp. The implementation is:

- **Well-tested**: 4 additional test scenarios covering success, no modifications, cache failure, and scan failure
- **Consistent**: Follows identical error handling and logging patterns as Build method
- **Architecture-compliant**: Matches the Refresh interface defined in docs/architecture/components.md
- **Performance-optimized**: Reduces indexing time for large vaults with many unchanged files

This additional functionality enhances the service without impacting the original story scope or requirements.
