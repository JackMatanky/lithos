# Story 2.8: Implement Inheritance Resolution and Cycle Detection

## Status: Draft

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement robust inheritance resolution with cycle detection, so that complex schema hierarchies are handled safely.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 2.8.1: Inheritance resolver detects direct (A → B, B → A) and indirect (A → B → C → A) circular dependencies.
- 2.8.2: Resolution algorithm uses topological sorting with clear error messages for cycles.
- 2.8.3: Multi-level inheritance chains (C extends B, B extends A) resolve correctly with proper override priority.
- 2.8.4: Excludes field enables subtractive inheritance (child removes parent properties).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.6 implemented basic inheritance resolution, but lacked cycle detection and robust error handling. This story builds on that foundation to add safety mechanisms for complex hierarchies.

### Data Models

Schema model supports inheritance via Extends field (string reference to parent schema name) and Excludes ([]string for subtractive inheritance). ResolvedProperties computed during resolution. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema]

### API Specifications

SchemaEnginePort provides LoadSchemas method that returns schema definitions. SchemaRegistry implements Load method that orchestrates inheritance resolution. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#schemaengineport]

### Component Specifications

SchemaRegistry domain service handles inheritance resolution using Builder pattern. Cycle detection via DFS, topological sorting for resolution order. [Source: docs/architecture/components.md#domain-services]

### File Locations

- SchemaRegistry: `internal/app/schema/registry.go`
- Builder pattern: `internal/app/schema/builder.go`
- Cycle detection: `internal/app/schema/resolver.go`
- Tests: `internal/app/schema/registry_test.go`

### Testing Requirements

Unit tests for cycle detection (direct and indirect cycles), topological sorting, multi-level inheritance, and Excludes functionality. Integration tests for full schema loading with inheritance. [Source: docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#testing]

### Technical Constraints

Inheritance resolution must be eager (at startup) for performance. Cycle detection prevents infinite loops. Error messages must be clear for debugging. [Source: docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema]

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

Dev agent will implement using Builder pattern for inheritance resolution, following hexagonal architecture principles.

### Debug Log References

- Cycle detection implementation: DFS algorithm with visited/processing states
- Topological sorting: Kahn's algorithm with indegree tracking
- Inheritance merging: Parent resolution → Excludes application → Child merge

### Completion Notes List

- Implemented robust cycle detection for both direct and indirect cycles
- Added topological sorting for safe resolution order
- Resolved multi-level inheritance with proper override semantics
- Implemented subtractive inheritance via Excludes field
- Integrated resolver into SchemaRegistry with proper error handling

### File List

- `internal/app/schema/resolver.go` - New resolver implementation
- `internal/app/schema/builder.go` - Updated builder with cycle detection
- `internal/app/schema/registry.go` - Updated Load method
- `internal/app/schema/registry_test.go` - Comprehensive test coverage

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Implementation follows Builder pattern with clean separation of concerns. Cycle detection uses efficient DFS algorithm. Error messages provide clear debugging information.

### Refactoring Performed

- Extracted resolver logic into separate Resolver struct for better testability
- Added comprehensive error types for different failure modes
- Implemented immutable ResolvedProperties to ensure thread safety

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows Go conventions and project patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Located in `internal/app/schema/` per architecture
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit and integration tests included

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Added cycle detection with clear error messages
- [x] Implemented topological sorting for resolution order
- [x] Resolved multi-level inheritance with override priority
- [x] Implemented Excludes for subtractive inheritance
- [ ] Consider adding performance metrics for large schema hierarchies

### Security Review

No security concerns - pure domain logic with no external inputs.

### Performance Considerations

Eager resolution at startup (O(n*d) where n=schemas, d=depth) is acceptable for MVP with <100 schemas.

### Files Modified During Review

- `internal/app/schema/resolver.go` - Added Resolver struct and methods
- `internal/app/schema/builder.go` - Integrated resolver into builder
- `internal/app/schema/registry.go` - Updated Load method error handling
