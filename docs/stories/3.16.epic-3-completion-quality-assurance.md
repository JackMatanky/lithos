5. Documentation must accurately reflect the implemented functionality
6. Regression testing must confirm no existing functionality was broken
7. Architecture compliance must be validated for all implemented fixes
8. Epic 3 must be ready for stories 3.17 (DI/E2E) and 3.18 (Documentation) completion

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Information

Based on docs/architecture/source-tree.md:

**Quality Assurance Scope:**
- All vault indexing components: `internal/app/vault/`, `internal/adapters/spi/vault/`, `internal/adapters/spi/cache/`
- Query service: `internal/app/query/service.go`
- Domain models: `internal/domain/note.go`, `internal/domain/config.go`
- Testing infrastructure: `tests/integration/`, `tests/utils/`

**Architecture Compliance Review:**
- Port interfaces: `internal/ports/spi/` - cache and vault ports
- Adapter implementations: `internal/adapters/spi/` - filesystem and cache adapters
- Domain services: `internal/app/` - vault indexing and query services
- Clean architecture boundaries and dependency directions

### Critical Issue Resolution Validation

Based on the Epic 3 course correction analysis, validate resolution of:

**Issue 1: Note ID Collision**
- Validation: Create vault with `projects/foo.md` and `ideas/foo.md`
- Expected: Two unique cache entries, both queryable via ByPath
- Test: Verify incremental refresh maps correctly to both notes

**Issue 2: Memory Usage with Binary Files**
- Validation: Create vault with large PDFs/images alongside markdown files
- Expected: Memory usage bounded to markdown content only
- Test: Monitor memory during scanning, verify binary files not loaded

**Issue 3: Cache Management Issues**
- Validation: Test incremental refresh after deleting vault files
- Expected: Orphaned cache entries removed, schema loaded correctly
- Test: Verify cache state matches vault state after operations

**Issue 4: Query Layer Failures**
- Validation: Test all QueryService methods with real data
- Expected: ByPath and ByBasename return correct results
- Test: Frontmatter queries handle all YAML types without panicking

**Issue 5: Cache Performance Issues**
- Validation: Compare cache performance before/after optimizations
- Expected: Faster writes, smaller files, graceful missing directory handling
- Test: Benchmark cache operations and fresh installation scenarios

### Architecture Compliance Validation

**Clean Architecture Principles:**
```go
// Validate domain layer has no infrastructure dependencies
func validateDomainLayerPurity(t *testing.T) {
    // Check internal/domain/ imports only standard library
    // Verify no direct filesystem, JSON, or external library dependencies
    // Validate domain models are pure data structures
}

// Validate port interfaces define contracts correctly
func validatePortContracts(t *testing.T) {
    // Verify CacheWriterPort and CacheReaderPort interfaces
    // Check VaultReaderPort contract matches implementation
    // Validate error types and contracts
}

// Validate adapter implementations respect boundaries
func validateAdapterBoundaries(t *testing.T) {
    // Check adapters only implement port interfaces
    // Verify adapters don't leak infrastructure details to domain
    // Validate dependency injection setup
}
```

**CQRS Pattern Compliance:**
```go
// Validate read/write separation in cache operations
func validateCQRSCompliance(t *testing.T) {
    // Verify CacheReader and CacheWriter have distinct responsibilities
    // Check QueryService uses read-side optimizations
    // Validate indexing uses write-side consistency
}
```

### Performance Validation Benchmarks

**Baseline Performance Requirements:**
- Vault indexing: < 5 seconds for 1000 markdown files
- Memory usage: < 100MB for vaults with large binary files
- Query response time: < 10ms for path-based lookups
- Cache operations: < 1ms per note for read/write operations

**Performance Test Scenarios:**
```go
func BenchmarkVaultIndexingBaseline(b *testing.B) {
    // Test with 1000 markdown files + 500 binary files
    // Measure indexing time and memory usage
    // Verify meets baseline requirements
}

func BenchmarkQueryPerformance(b *testing.B) {
    // Test all QueryService methods with large dataset
    // Measure response times for various query types
    // Verify meets response time requirements
}

func BenchmarkCacheOperations(b *testing.B) {
    // Test cache read/write/delete operations
    // Measure operation times and memory efficiency
    // Compare with pre-optimization baselines
}
```

### Comprehensive Test Coverage Requirements

**Test Coverage Metrics:**
- Unit test coverage: > 90% for critical path components
- Integration test coverage: 100% of identified critical issues
- End-to-end test coverage: All major user workflows
- Error path coverage: All error conditions and edge cases

**Test Scenarios:**
```go
// Test comprehensive vault scenarios
func TestCompleteVaultScenarios(t *testing.T) {
    scenarios := []struct {
        name string
        vault VaultSetup
        expectedResults ExpectedResults
    }{
        {
            name: "Simple vault with unique basenames",
            vault: SimpleVaultSetup{...},
            expectedResults: ExpectedResults{...},
        },
        {
            name: "Complex vault with duplicate basenames",
            vault: ComplexVaultSetup{...},
            expectedResults: ExpectedResults{...},
        },
        {
            name: "Large vault with binary files",
            vault: LargeVaultSetup{...},
            expectedResults: ExpectedResults{...},
        },
        // ... additional scenarios
    }

    for _, scenario := range scenarios {
        t.Run(scenario.name, func(t *testing.T) {
            // Execute complete workflow and validate results
        })
    }
}
```
