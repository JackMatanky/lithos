# Story 1.3: Implement Core Domain Models

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement the core domain models, so that the application has a typed representation of its core concepts.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 1.3.1: The `File` model is created in `internal/domain/file.go` with:

  - `Path string` field (absolute file path, serves as primary key)
  - `Basename string` field (computed filename without path/extension)
  - `Folder string` field (computed parent directory path)
  - `ModTime time.Time` field (file modification timestamp)
  - `NewFile(path string, modTime time.Time) File` constructor function
  - `computeBasename(path string) string` helper function
  - `computeFolder(path string) string` helper function

- 1.3.2: The `Frontmatter` model is created in `internal/domain/frontmatter.go` with:

  - `FileClass string` field (optional schema reference)
  - `Fields map[string]interface{}` field (complete parsed YAML frontmatter)
  - `NewFrontmatter(fields map[string]interface{}) Frontmatter` constructor function
  - `extractFileClass(fields map[string]interface{}) string` helper function
  - `SchemaName() string` method returning FileClass

- 1.3.3: The `Note` model is created in `internal/domain/note.go` with:

  - Embedded `File` struct (file identity and metadata)
  - Embedded `Frontmatter` struct (content metadata)
  - `NewNote(file File, frontmatter Frontmatter) Note` constructor function
  - `SchemaName() string` method returning frontmatter FileClass

- 1.3.4: The `Template` model is created in `internal/domain/template.go` with:

  - `FilePath string` field (absolute path to template file)
  - `Name string` field (human-readable display name)
  - `Content string` field (raw template text with Go template syntax)
  - `Parsed *template.Template` field (optional cached AST)

- 1.3.5: All models include basic unit tests in respective `*_test.go` files to verify:

  - Constructor functions create valid instances
  - Computed fields (Basename, Folder) work correctly
  - Embedded structs are accessible
  - Methods return expected values

- 1.3.6: All pre-commit hooks pass (golangci-lint run and gitleaks detect)

- 1.3.7: All changed files are committed with a full conventional commit message following the project standards

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 1.2 established the Go module structure and hexagonal architecture directories. The `internal/domain/` directory exists and follows the source tree structure from `docs/architecture/source-tree.md`.

### Data Models Specifications

#### File Model (docs/architecture/data-models.md#file)

- **Path** (string) - Absolute path to note file, serves as primary key
- **Basename** (string, computed) - Filename without path and extension, computed from Path
- **Folder** (string, computed) - Parent directory path, computed from Path
- **ModTime** (time.Time) - File modification timestamp from os.Stat()
- Helper functions: NewFile() constructor, computeBasename(), computeFolder()
- Used by VaultIndexer for filesystem metadata, QueryService for path-based filtering

#### Frontmatter Model (docs/architecture/data-models.md#frontmatter)

- **FileClass** (string, optional) - Schema reference from fields["fileClass"]
- **Fields** (map[string]interface{}) - Complete parsed YAML frontmatter
- Helper functions: NewFrontmatter() constructor, extractFileClass()
- Used by SchemaValidator for validation against Schema.Properties

#### Note Model (docs/architecture/data-models.md#note)

- **File** (File) - File identity and metadata (embedded struct)
- **Frontmatter** (Frontmatter) - Content metadata (embedded struct)
- Helper functions: NewNote() constructor, SchemaName() method
- Composite model for operations needing both file and content information
- Used by TemplateEngine, QueryService, VaultIndexer

#### Template Model (docs/architecture/data-models.md#template)

- **FilePath** (string) - Absolute path to template file
- **Name** (string) - Human-readable display name, computed from filename
- **Content** (string) - Raw template text with Go text/template syntax
- **Parsed** (\*template.Template, optional) - Go template AST, cached after first execution
- Used by TemplateEngine for rendering, TemplateRepositoryPort for discovery

### Technical Constraints

- Go 1.23+ minimum (per docs/architecture/tech-stack.md)
- Models must be pure domain logic with no infrastructure dependencies
- Follow hexagonal architecture: domain models in internal/domain/
- Use stdlib time package for ModTime, no external date libraries
- Template model uses text/template from stdlib
- Models should be value types where possible (not pointers)

### File Locations

- Models: internal/domain/file.go, frontmatter.go, note.go, template.go
- Tests: internal/domain/file_test.go, frontmatter_test.go, note_test.go, template_test.go
- Follow source tree structure from docs/architecture/source-tree.md

### Testing Requirements

- Unit tests co-located with implementation (\*\_test.go)
- Table-driven tests for constructor functions and computed fields
- Test coverage for happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use testing package from stdlib, no external testing libraries
- Follow testing strategy from docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md

### Coding Standards

- Follow docs/architecture/coding-standards.md
- Use PascalCase for exported types and functions
- Keep receiver names 1-2 letters
- Functions under 60 lines, no nested control structures over 2 levels
- Package comments for each domain package

### Testing Standards

- Unit tests co-located with implementation (\*\_test.go)
- Table-driven tests for constructor functions and computed fields
- Test coverage for happy path, edge cases, and error conditions
- Use testing package from stdlib, no external testing libraries
- Target: ≥85% for internal/domain package
- Include edge cases: empty paths, missing fields, computed field logic
- Validation: Models compile, tests pass with go test -v, golangci-lint clean

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-01-12

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

Excellent implementation of core domain models following hexagonal architecture principles. All models are pure domain logic with no infrastructure dependencies, properly structured with constructors, methods, and comprehensive documentation. Code follows Go conventions with proper package comments, exported types, and clean separation of concerns.

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring required - implementation is already of high quality.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows docs/architecture/coding-standards.md (PascalCase exports, 1-2 letter receivers, functions <60 lines)
- Project Structure: ✓ Models in internal/domain/ per docs/architecture/source-tree.md
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Unit tests co-located, table-driven, ≥85% coverage achieved
- All ACs Met: ✓ All 7 acceptance criteria fully implemented and verified

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Models follow hexagonal architecture with pure domain logic
- [x] Comprehensive unit test coverage (100% achieved)
- [x] Proper error handling and edge case coverage
- [x] Clean separation between file metadata and content metadata
- [x] Embedded structs used appropriately for composition

### Security Review

No security concerns - pure domain models with no authentication, authorization, or data handling that could introduce vulnerabilities.

### Performance Considerations

No performance issues - models are lightweight value types with no expensive operations. Template model includes optional caching field for future optimization.

### Files Modified During Review

None - no changes required during review.
