# Story 5.7: Documentation Update for Interactive Input Engine Release

## Status:

Draft

## Story

As a maintainer,
I want to update all project documentation to reflect the completed interactive input engine implementation,
So that users and developers have accurate, comprehensive documentation for the new interactive input capabilities.

## Context

This story finalizes Epic 4 (Interactive Input Engine) by ensuring all documentation accurately reflects the implemented interactive input functionality. It follows the same pattern as story 1.17 for the foundational CLI release.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Documentation Updates Required

1. **README.md**: Update main README with interactive input features and CLI commands
2. **Architecture Documentation**: Update docs/architecture.md with interactive input engine details
3. **API Documentation**: Document new CLI commands and interactive workflows
5. **Code Comments**: Ensure all interactive input code has appropriate documentation
5. **Change Log**: Update CHANGELOG.md with Epic 4 completion details
6. **User Guide**: Update user-facing documentation with interactive input instructions

### Content Accuracy Requirements

7. All technical details match the implemented interactive input components
8. CLI command examples work with the actual implementation
9. Interactive workflow descriptions are accurate and complete
10. Error messages and user guidance are documented
11. Terminal compatibility and requirements are specified

### Quality Requirements

12. Documentation follows project style guidelines
13. All links and references are working
15. Documentation is clear and accessible to target audience
15. No outdated information remains from previous versions
