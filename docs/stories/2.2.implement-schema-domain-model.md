# Story 2.2: Implement Schema Domain Model

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement the Schema model from the architecture, so that I have a foundation for schema definitions.

## Context Source

- **Source**: Epic 2 - Configuration & Schema Loading
- **Enhancement Type**: Domain model implementation for schema system
- **Integration Points**: Schema model used by SchemaRegistry and SchemaValidator services
- **Goal**: Establish core domain model for schema-based metadata validation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.2.1: `internal/domain/` contains Schema model with Name, Extends, Excludes, Properties, and ResolvedProperties fields per `docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema`.
2.2.2: Schema model includes proper JSON tags for serialization per `docs/architecture/tech-stack.md#json-processing`.
2.2.3: Schema model has unit tests for field validation and initialization.
2.2.4: Schema model implements basic validation methods for field constraints.
2.2.5: Schema model supports string-based Extends references for inheritance (resolution handled by SchemaRegistry).

**Integration Requirements:**

2.2.6: Schema model integrates with Property model for property definitions.
2.2.7: Schema model follows domain-driven design principles with proper encapsulation.
2.2.8: Schema model is serializable for use by SchemaEnginePort adapters.

**Quality Requirements:**

2.2.9: Unit tests cover Schema model behavior and validation.
2.2.10: Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions.
2.2.11: Schema model includes proper error handling for invalid field values.

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: Basic domain models exist (File, Frontmatter, Note) but Schema model not yet implemented
- **Technology Stack**: Go 1.23+ with stdlib JSON for serialization
- **Integration Points**: Schema model used by SchemaRegistry for loading and SchemaValidator for validation
- **Architecture Pattern**: Domain Core model following hexagonal architecture

### Integration Approach

- **Safe Implementation**: Create new domain model without affecting existing functionality
- **JSON Compatibility**: Ensure model can be unmarshaled from JSON schema files
- **Inheritance Support**: Implement string-based parent references for schema hierarchies
- **Property Integration**: Schema contains Property slices for validation rules

### Technical Constraints

- **Domain Core**: Schema model belongs in `internal/domain/` as pure business logic
- **JSON Serialization**: Use Go stdlib `encoding/json` with proper struct tags
- **Inheritance Semantics**: Support multi-level inheritance chains with Excludes for subtractive inheritance
- **Type Safety**: All fields properly typed, no interface{} overuse

### Key Files to Modify/Create

- `internal/domain/schema.go` - **CREATE** - Schema model implementation
- `internal/domain/schema_test.go` - **CREATE** - Unit tests for Schema model
- `internal/domain/property.go` - **REFERENCE** - Existing Property model integration

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test Schema model creation, JSON serialization, inheritance logic
- **Validation Tests**: Test field validation and error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Test schema loading from JSON files

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Basic validation methods implemented for field constraints
- [x] JSON serialization/deserialization works correctly
- [x] Domain-driven design principles followed with proper encapsulation
- [x] Unit tests pass with adequate coverage for model behavior
- [x] Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions
- [x] Error handling implemented for invalid field values

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Schema model field validation may miss edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive unit tests covering all validation scenarios
- **Verification**: Test with various schema configurations and edge cases
- **JSON Compatibility Risk**: JSON serialization may not match expected format
- **Mitigation**: Test JSON marshaling/unmarshaling with sample schema data
- **Integration Risk**: Schema model may not integrate properly with Property model
- **Mitigation**: Ensure Property model compatibility during implementation

### Rollback Plan

- **Git Rollback**: Revert to previous commit if model implementation fails
- **File Removal**: Delete new schema files if integration issues arise
- **Testing Verification**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Story 2.1 will implement Config model providing foundation for configuration management
- This story builds on domain model patterns established in Epic 1 (File, Frontmatter, Note models)
- Hexagonal architecture patterns established in Story 1.14/1.15 provide guidance for domain model placement

**Data Models:**
- Schema model defined in `docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema` with required fields: Name, Extends, Excludes, Properties, ResolvedProperties
- Name: Unique schema identifier matching fileClass values
- Extends: String-based parent schema reference for inheritance (resolution handled by SchemaRegistry)
- Excludes: Array of property names to remove from inherited schemas (processing by SchemaRegistry)
- Properties: Array of Property definitions for this schema
- ResolvedProperties: Computed flattened properties after inheritance resolution (computed by SchemaRegistry)

**API Specifications:**
- Schema model is pure domain core, no direct API exposure
- Used by SchemaRegistry domain service for loading and inheritance resolution per components.md
- Consumed by SchemaValidator domain service for validation against note frontmatter
- Loaded by SchemaEnginePort adapter from JSON schema files per components.md
- Integrated with Property model for validation rules composition

**Component Specifications:**
- Schema model located in `internal/domain/schema.go`
- Follows domain-driven design with proper encapsulation
- Supports JSON serialization for loading from schema files
- Inheritance resolution handled by SchemaRegistry using Builder pattern

**File Locations:**
- Schema model: `internal/domain/schema.go` (create new)
- Schema tests: `internal/domain/schema_test.go` (create new)
- Property model: `internal/domain/property.go` (reference existing)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for Schema model field validation and initialization
- Unit tests for JSON serialization and unmarshaling
- Unit tests for basic validation methods
- Integration tests for schema loading from JSON files

**Technical Constraints:**
- Follow domain core principles: pure business logic, no infrastructure dependencies
- Use Go stdlib JSON for serialization with proper struct tags
- Inheritance resolution delegated to SchemaRegistry domain service
- Support subtractive inheritance via Excludes field for flexible schema hierarchies

## Dev Agent Record

### Agent Model Used

James (Full Stack Developer)

### Debug Log References

- Reviewed `docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema` for field expectations
- Compared existing domain patterns in `internal/domain/file.go` and `internal/domain/frontmatter.go`
- Cross-checked property serialization behavior via `internal/domain/property_test.go`
- Consulted `internal/shared/errors` for validation error conventions

### Completion Notes List

- Added spec-aware JSON marshaling helpers in `internal/domain/property.go` so enum, range, and path metadata serialize correctly for both pointer and value specs.
- Updated `NewProperty` to infer and persist the type discriminator, keeping Property instances consistent regardless of construction path.
- Hardened `Schema.Validate` to reject invalid `extends` identifiers, self-references, and malformed/duplicate `excludes` entries.
- Expanded `internal/domain/schema_test.go` with new table cases covering the tightened validation logic and inheritance metadata.
- Decomposed property spec serialization into decoder/field extractor helpers and refreshed `internal/domain/property_test.go` constants to satisfy linting guidance.
- Verified the full suite with `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.cache/go-build go test -mod=mod ./...` to ensure domain and integration packages remain green.
