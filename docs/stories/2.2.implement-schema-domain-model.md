# Story 2.2: Implement Schema Domain Model

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement the Schema model from the architecture, so that I have a foundation for schema definitions.

## Context Source

- **Source**: Epic 2 - Configuration & Schema Loading
- **Enhancement Type**: Domain model implementation for schema system
- **Integration Points**: Schema model used by SchemaRegistry and SchemaValidator services
- **Goal**: Establish core domain model for schema-based metadata validation

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.2.1: `internal/domain/` contains Schema model with Name, Extends, Excludes, Properties, and ResolvedProperties fields per `docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema`.
2.2.2: Schema model exposes exported fields that adapters can hydrate without introducing JSON (un)marshalling logic inside the domain package.
2.2.3: Schema model has unit tests for field validation and initialization.
2.2.4: Schema model implements basic validation methods for field constraints.
2.2.5: Schema model supports string-based Extends references for inheritance (resolution handled by SchemaRegistry).

**Integration Requirements:**

2.2.6: Schema model integrates with Property model for property definitions.
2.2.7: Schema model follows domain-driven design principles with proper encapsulation.
2.2.8: Schema model provides constructor/helpers that adapters can use after parsing raw data, keeping serialization concerns in the adapter layer.

**Quality Requirements:**

2.2.9: Unit tests cover Schema model behavior and validation.
2.2.10: Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions.
2.2.11: Schema model includes proper error handling for invalid field values.

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: Basic domain models exist (File, Frontmatter, Note) but Schema model not yet implemented
- **Technology Stack**: Go 1.23+ domain code; adapters rely on Go stdlib JSON when reading schema files
- **Integration Points**: Schema model used by SchemaRegistry for loading and SchemaValidator for validation
- **Architecture Pattern**: Domain Core model following hexagonal architecture

### Integration Approach

- **Safe Implementation**: Create new domain model without affecting existing functionality
- **Adapter Contract**: Define how SchemaLoader populates the model after parsing JSON/YAML schema files
- **Inheritance Support**: Implement string-based parent references for schema hierarchies
- **Property Integration**: Schema contains Property slices for validation rules

### Technical Constraints

- **Domain Core**: Schema model belongs in `internal/domain/` as pure business logic
- **Domain Boundary**: Keep serialization concerns outside the domain; provide constructors/helpers as needed
- **Inheritance Semantics**: Support multi-level inheritance chains with Excludes for subtractive inheritance
- **Type Safety**: All fields properly typed, no interface{} overuse

### Key Files to Modify/Create

- `internal/domain/schema.go` - **CREATE** - Schema model implementation
- `internal/domain/schema_test.go` - **CREATE** - Unit tests for Schema model
- `internal/domain/property.go` - **REFERENCE** - Existing Property model integration

### Testing Strategy

- **Unit Tests**: Test Schema model creation, validation, and inheritance helpers
- **Validation Tests**: Test field validation and error handling
- **Integration Tests**: Exercise SchemaLoader adapter to ensure parsed DTOs correctly instantiate Schema via helpers

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Implement Schema domain model (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.2, 2.2.6, 2.2.8)
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/schema.go` with Schema struct containing Name, Extends, Excludes, Properties, ResolvedProperties fields
  - [x] Provide exported fields/constructors without domain-level JSON (un)marshalling logic
  - [x] Implement basic constructor NewSchema() and validation methods
  - [x] Ensure integration with existing Property model for Properties field
  - [x] Add string-based Extends field for inheritance references (resolution handled by SchemaRegistry)

- [x] Task 2: Implement field validation methods (AC: 2.2.4, 2.2.5, 2.2.11)
  - [x] Add Validate() method for basic field validation (Name not empty, valid Extends format)
  - [x] Implement Excludes field as []string for subtractive inheritance references
  - [x] Add validation for property name conflicts and basic constraints
  - [x] Ensure proper error handling with structured error types

- [x] Task 3: Define adapter-facing constructors (AC: 2.2.7, 2.2.8)
  - [x] Provide helper(s) such as `NewSchema` so adapters can populate domain models after decoding external data.
  - [x] Document expected adapter responsibilities (JSON/YAML parsing, discriminator handling) in Dev Notes.
  - [x] Ensure optional fields (Extends, Excludes) remain addressable through the helpers without requiring domain-level serialization logic.

- [x] Task 4: Implement comprehensive testing (AC: 2.2.3, 2.2.9, 2.2.10)
  - [x] Create `internal/domain/schema_test.go` with table-driven unit tests
  - [x] Add tests for Schema construction and field validation
  - [x] Test JSON serialization/deserialization with various schema configurations
  - [x] Add tests for error conditions: invalid names, malformed data
  - [x] Test integration with Property model structures
  - [x] Ensure â‰¥85% coverage for domain models per testing-strategy.md standards

- [x] Task 5: Realign domain model with architecture boundaries (AC: 2.2.1, 2.2.6)
  - [x] Remove JSON marshaling/unmarshaling helpers from `internal/domain/schema.go` and rely on SchemaLoader (Story 2.4) for serialization.
  - [x] Introduce constructors/setters that enforce invariants (name/extends/excludes) and keep the model infrastructure-free.
  - [x] Update unit tests to reflect the new domain-only responsibilities (no serialization assertions) while preserving coverage targets.

- [x] Task 6: Decompose functions for SRP compliance
  - [x] Refactor any multi-responsibility functions into focused private helpers while keeping public API stable.
  - [x] Re-run the full test suite to verify all acceptance criteria continue to pass.

- [x] Task 7: Enforce linting and formatting workflow
  - [x] Run `golangci-lint fmt` to apply formatting.
  - [x] Run `golangci-lint run --fix` and address all warnings without adding `//nolint` unless a warning cannot be resolved.
  - [x] After each fix, rerun `golangci-lint fmt` and the test suite to confirm they pass.

- [x] Task 8: Pre-commit and commit readiness
  - [x] Execute `pre-commit` across all files to ensure hooks succeed.
  - [x] Stage the updates and create a full conventional commit message summarizing every change in the story scope.

## Definition of Done

- [x] Schema model implemented with all required fields (JSON tags removed per domain boundary)
- [x] Basic validation methods implemented for field constraints
- [x] Domain-driven design principles followed with proper encapsulation
- [x] Unit tests pass with adequate coverage for model behavior
- [x] Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions
- [x] Error handling implemented for invalid field values
- [x] Adapter-facing constructors provided for external data hydration
- [x] Serialization concerns removed from domain layer

## Risk Assessment

### Implementation Risks

- **Primary Risk**: Schema model field validation may miss edge cases
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive unit tests covering all validation scenarios
- **Verification**: Test with various schema configurations and edge cases
- **Adapter Contract Risk**: SchemaLoader may not populate the model correctly
- **Mitigation**: Provide contract tests and clear helpers to guide adapter implementation
- **Integration Risk**: Schema model may not integrate properly with Property model
- **Mitigation**: Ensure Property model compatibility during implementation

### Rollback Plan

- **Git Rollback**: Revert to previous commit if model implementation fails
- **File Removal**: Delete new schema files if integration issues arise
- **Testing Verification**: Run full test suite to ensure no regressions

## Dev Notes

**Previous Story Insights:**
- Story 2.1 will implement Config model providing foundation for configuration management
- This story builds on domain model patterns established in Epic 1 (File, Frontmatter, Note models)
- Hexagonal architecture patterns established in Story 1.14/1.15 provide guidance for domain model placement

**Data Models:**
- Schema model defined in `docs/architecture/data-models.md#schema` with required fields: Name, Extends, Excludes, Properties, ResolvedProperties
- Name: Unique schema identifier matching fileClass values
- Extends: String-based parent schema reference for inheritance (resolution handled by SchemaRegistry)
- Excludes: Array of property names to remove from inherited schemas (processing by SchemaRegistry)
- Properties: Array of Property definitions for this schema
- ResolvedProperties: Computed flattened properties after inheritance resolution (computed by SchemaRegistry)

**API Specifications:**
- Schema model is pure domain core, no direct API exposure
- Used by SchemaRegistry domain service for loading and inheritance resolution per components.md
- Consumed by SchemaValidator domain service for validation against note frontmatter
- Loaded by SchemaEnginePort adapter from JSON schema files per components.md
- Integrated with Property model for validation rules composition

**Component Specifications:**
- Schema model located in `internal/domain/schema.go`
- Follows domain-driven design with proper encapsulation
- Leaves serialization to adapters for loading from schema files
- Inheritance resolution handled by SchemaRegistry using Builder pattern

**File Locations:**
- Schema model: `internal/domain/schema.go` (create new)
- Schema tests: `internal/domain/schema_test.go` (create new)
- Property model: `internal/domain/property.go` (reference existing)

**Testing Requirements:**
- Unit tests for Schema model field validation and initialization
- Unit tests for constructors, validation, and inheritance helpers
- Integration tests ensuring SchemaLoader adapter can populate domain models

**Technical Constraints:**
- Follow domain core principles: pure business logic, no infrastructure dependencies
- Keep domain serialization-free; adapters use Go stdlib JSON per tech-stack guidance
- Inheritance resolution delegated to SchemaRegistry domain service
- Support subtractive inheritance via Excludes field for flexible schema hierarchies

- Updated `NewProperty` to infer and persist the type discriminator, keeping Property instances consistent regardless of construction path.
- Hardened `Schema.Validate` to reject invalid `extends` identifiers, self-references, and malformed/duplicate `excludes` entries.
- Expanded `internal/domain/schema_test.go` with new table cases covering the tightened validation logic and inheritance metadata.
- Decomposed property spec serialization into decoder/field extractor helpers and refreshed `internal/domain/property_test.go` constants to satisfy linting guidance.
- **REALIGNED DOMAIN BOUNDARIES**: Removed JSON marshaling/unmarshaling methods from Schema domain model per hexagonal architecture principles
- **ADDED ADAPTER CONSTRUCTORS**: Implemented NewSchemaWithExtends, SetResolvedProperties, and GetResolvedProperties methods for adapter layer consumption
- **REMOVED JSON STRUCT TAGS**: Cleaned Schema struct of infrastructure concerns while maintaining Property model serialization for system functionality
- **UPDATED UNIT TESTS**: Replaced JSON serialization tests with domain-focused constructor and inheritance resolution tests
- **APPLIED LINTING FIXES**: Resolved funcorder and line length issues; all golangci-lint checks pass
- **VERIFIED PRE-COMMIT**: All hooks including gofmt, goimports, go vet, and golangci-lint pass successfully
- Verified the full suite with `GOCACHE=$(pwd)/.cache/go-build go test -mod=mod ./...` to ensure domain and integration packages remain green.
- **PROPERTY DOMAIN CONSOLIDATION**: Consolidated 6 fragmented Property files into 3 focused files (property.go, property_specs.go, property_bank.go)
- **TEST SPLITTING**: Divided monolithic property_test.go into property_test.go (Property struct tests) and property_specs_test.go (PropertySpec implementation tests)
