# Story 1.14: Introduce Shared Test Filesystem Utilities

## Status

Approved

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** reusable helpers that manage temporary filesystem state and fixture copying in tests,
**so that** tests never leak files, always clean up, and consistently consume the project testdata.

### Context

- Supports Epic 1 (Foundational CLI static template engine) by stabilizing end-to-end and integration tests that exercise the CLI against real vault data.
- Reduces flaky behaviour observed when prior stories (`tests/e2e/*`, Story 1.16) created ad-hoc temp directories and left residual files in developer environments.

### Dependencies

- Blocked by Story 1.15: Normalize Project Testdata Fixtures (canonical directory layout and helper API).
- Consumes the helper introduced in Story 1.15 for resolving fixture paths.

### Assumptions

- Test suites run under Go's `testing` framework with `testify` helpers available.
- Story 1.15 delivers snake_case fixture names and removes legacy `testdata/schemas` duplication.
- No additional persistent filesystem mutations should be introduced outside the new workspace helper.

## Acceptance Criteria

- 1.14.1: Create `tests/utils/tempfs.go` exporting `NewWorkspace(t *testing.T)` that wraps `t.Helper()` and `t.TempDir()` to return a struct with helpers:
  - `Root() string` for the absolute root path.
  - `Path(rel ...string) string` joining paths under the root and failing the test if the join escapes the workspace (use `filepath.Rel`).
  - `MkdirAll(rel string, perm fs.FileMode)` and `WriteFile(rel string, data []byte, perm fs.FileMode)` that call `t.Helper()` and ensure the operation stays within the workspace.
  - Register `t.Cleanup` to delete the workspace on test completion via `os.RemoveAll` and log failures with `require.NoError`.

- 1.14.2: Provide `CopyFromTestdata(t *testing.T, workspace *Workspace, relDest string, fixturePath ...string)` helper that pulls fixtures via the forthcoming `testdata` utility (Story 1.15) and copies directories/files into the workspace using a single implementation.

- 1.14.3: Replace ad-hoc filesystem setup in:
  - `tests/e2e/lithos_schema_test.go`
  - `tests/e2e/lithos_new_test.go`
  - `tests/integration/schema_system_test.go`
  - `tests/integration/config_loading_test.go`
  - Any other suite that uses `os.MkdirTemp`, `os.RemoveAll`, or inline copy helpers
  so they rely on `tempfs.Workspace` utilities instead. Remove duplicate `copyDir`/`copyFile` helpers.

- 1.14.4: Ensure helpers work with Go’s `testing` package and `testify` assertions. Add unit coverage inside `tests/utils/tempfs_test.go` verifying:
  - Workspace cleanup triggers via `t.Cleanup` even when tests fail (simulate failure, assert directory removed).
  - `Path()` rejects attempts to escape the workspace (e.g., `../outside.json`) and returns a `require.Fail` message.
  - Copy helper faithfully mirrors files and directories from fixtures delivered by Story 1.15, preserving permissions.

- 1.14.5: Update test documentation (`README` under `tests/` if present) to describe the new utilities and mandate their usage when interacting with the filesystem. Highlight the escape-prevention and cleanup guarantees.

- 1.14.6: Run `go test ./...` and `golangci-lint run ./...` to confirm no regressions after refactoring suites to the new helpers, and capture evidence of the new scenarios (workspace cleanup log, path-escape failure) in the story Change Log.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Scaffold workspace helper (AC: 1.14.1)
  - [ ] Create `tests/utils/tempfs.go` with a `Workspace` struct backed by `t.TempDir()` and expose `Root()`.
  - [ ] Implement `MkdirAll()` and `WriteFile()` to operate relative to the workspace and wrap errors with `require.NoError`.

- [x] Task 2: Guard workspace boundaries (AC: 1.14.1)
  - [ ] Implement `Path()` using `filepath.Rel` to block `..` traversal and fail the test via `require.Fail` when escaping.
  - [ ] Register `t.Cleanup` in the constructor to remove the workspace via `os.RemoveAll` and assert success.

- [x] Task 3: Add fixture copy helper (AC: 1.14.2)
  - [ ] Implement `CopyFromTestdata` that reads fixtures via `tests/utils/testdata.go` (Story 1.15) and copies files.
  - [ ] Extend the helper to recursively copy directories while preserving 0o750/0o600 permissions.

- [x] Task 4: Unit-test workspace utilities (AC: 1.14.4)
  - [ ] Create `tests/utils/tempfs_test.go` covering cleanup-on-failure behaviour and path-escape rejection.
  - [ ] Add table-driven tests verifying file and directory copies using fixtures from Story 1.15.

- [x] Task 5: Refactor e2e tests (AC: 1.14.3)
  - [ ] Update `tests/e2e/lithos_schema_test.go` to use `tempfs.NewWorkspace` and drop local `copyDir`.
  - [ ] Update `tests/e2e/lithos_new_test.go` similarly to rely on the shared helper.

- [x] Task 6: Refactor integration tests (AC: 1.14.3)
  - [ ] Update `tests/integration/schema_system_test.go` to use the shared workspace helper and remove duplicate helpers.
  - [ ] Update `tests/integration/config_loading_test.go` to rely on the shared helper.

- [x] Task 7: Remove legacy copy helpers (AC: 1.14.3)
  - [ ] Replace `utils.CopyFile` in `tests/utils/mocks.go` with the new utilities or delete if unused.
  - [ ] Run `rg "os.MkdirTemp" tests` and document remaining intentional usages in Dev Notes.

- [x] Task 8: Update testing documentation (AC: 1.14.5)
  - [ ] Add a section to `tests/README.md` describing `tempfs.Workspace` usage and cleanup guarantees.

- [x] Task 9: Execute validations and record evidence (AC: 1.14.6)
  - [ ] Run `go test ./...` and attach the summary/output to the Change Log.
  - [ ] Run `golangci-lint run ./...` and confirm no lint violations.
  - [ ] Capture test names/logs demonstrating workspace cleanup and path-escape failures in the Change Log.

## Dev Notes

### Source Tree Context

- `tests/utils/tempfs.go` – new helper module for workspace utilities.
- `tests/utils/testdata.go` – helper introduced by Story 1.15 that this story consumes.
- Existing suites touched: `tests/e2e`, `tests/integration`.

### Architecture References

- Tests must follow patterns defined in `docs/architecture/testing-strategy.md` (table-driven tests, testify assertions).
- Coding standards: `docs/architecture/coding-standards.md` (enforce error handling with `require.NoError` in tests).
- Tech stack: Go 1.23, testify (`github.com/stretchr/testify`), standard library `os`, `path/filepath`.

### Assumptions & Decisions

- Story 1.15 delivers canonical `testdata` layout and helper; this story must not merge until 1.15 completes.
- Helper must prevent writes outside workspace; failures should use `require.Fail` with descriptive messages.
- Migration should not introduce persistent artifacts outside `t.TempDir()` roots.

#### Testing

- Unit tests live under `tests/utils/tempfs_test.go` and follow Go naming conventions.
- For suites refactored, ensure existing regression suites (`tests/e2e`, `tests/integration`) still run via `go test ./...`.
- Validate permission preservation (dirs default 0o750, files 0o600) in helper tests.
- QA test design reference: `docs/qa/assessments/1.14-test-design-20251030.md` for detailed scenario mapping.
