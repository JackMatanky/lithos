# Story 2.6: Implement Inheritance Resolution

## Status

Done

## Story

As a developer, I want to implement inheritance resolution in the SchemaRegistryAdapter, so that schema hierarchies are properly resolved.

## Acceptance Criteria

**Functional Requirements:**

2.6.1: Builder pattern resolves inheritance by: loading all schemas → building dependency graph → detecting cycles → resolving in topological order.
2.6.2: ResolvedProperties are computed by merging parent properties, applying Excludes, then merging child Properties.
2.6.3: Inheritance resolution handles multi-level chains (C extends B, B extends A) with proper property override priority.
2.6.4: Cycle detection provides clear error messages identifying the circular dependency path.
2.6.5: ResolvedProperties are immutable after inheritance resolution to ensure thread safety.

**Integration Requirements:**

2.6.6: Inheritance resolution integrates with existing SchemaRegistryAdapter (SPI adapter from Story 2.5).
2.6.7: Builder pattern uses existing Schema and Property domain models.
2.6.8: Resolution process follows SPI adapter patterns with proper error handling.

**Quality Requirements:**

2.6.9: Unit tests cover inheritance resolution logic and cycle detection.
2.6.10: Code follows project coding standards and naming conventions.
2.6.11: Comprehensive error handling for circular dependencies and invalid references.

## Technical Guidance

### Existing System Context

- **Current State**: SchemaRegistryAdapter (SPI adapter from Story 2.5) loads schemas, Schema/Property models support inheritance fields
- **Technology Stack**: Go 1.23+ minimum (Go 1.25+ preferred per coding standards) with SPI adapter patterns, topological sorting for dependency resolution
- **Integration Points**: Inheritance resolution enhances SchemaRegistryAdapter with proper property resolution
- **Architecture Pattern**: Builder pattern in SPI adapter layer for complex schema processing

### Integration Approach

- **Builder Pattern**: Implement inheritance resolution as builder pattern within SchemaRegistry
- **Topological Sorting**: Use dependency graph and topological ordering for safe resolution
- **Property Merging**: Implement proper property override semantics with Excludes support.
  Example: if `note` defines properties `title`, `tags`, and `created`, and `meeting-note` extends `note` while excluding `created` and overriding `tags`, the resolver should (1) copy the parent's `title`, `tags`, `created` into an intermediate list, (2) drop `created` because it appears in `meeting-note.Excludes`, and (3) replace the parent's `tags` with the child definition before appending any additional child-only properties such as `agenda`.
- **Cycle Detection**: Use DFS-based cycle detection with clear error reporting

### Technical Constraints

- **Domain Service**: Inheritance resolution belongs in SchemaRegistry as business logic
- **Thread Safety**: ResolvedProperties must be immutable after resolution
- **Error Handling**: Follow project Result[T] patterns for inheritance errors
- **Performance**: Resolution happens at startup, optimize for correctness over speed

## QA Results

### Pre-Implementation Review

**Status**: Story needs completion and dependency resolution before implementation

**Key Issues Identified:**
- Story dependencies: Requires completion of Stories 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5 for Schema/Property models and SchemaRegistry
- Tasks need to be completed sequentially before story can be approved
- Duplicate Task 4 definitions need to be resolved (line conflict identified)
- Builder pattern implementation needs more algorithmic detail for complex inheritance scenarios

**Critical Dependencies:**
- Story 2.2: Schema domain model with Extends/Excludes/Properties fields
- Story 2.3: Property domain models for property merging logic
- Story 2.5: SchemaRegistry service for integration point

**Critical Algorithm Requirements:**
- Topological sorting algorithm for dependency resolution
- DFS-based cycle detection with path tracking
- Property merging semantics: parent → excludes → child override priority

**Recommendations:**
- Wait for Stories 2.2, 2.3, and 2.5 completion before implementing
- Complete Task 1-8 sequentially with focus on algorithmic correctness
- Add detailed inheritance scenarios to test suite (A→B→C chains, complex Excludes)
- Ensure thread-safety of ResolvedProperties after inheritance resolution
