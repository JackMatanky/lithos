# Next Steps

- Review this architecture with the Product Owner and Scrum Master to ensure scope alignment before development starts.
- Hand off this document and the PRD to the Dev agent for story implementation of the CLI-focused MVP.
- Coordinate with DevOps to finalize GitHub Actions + `goreleaser` automation, including signed release verification.
- Establish a quarterly dependency audit (owners: PO + Architect) that evaluates `promptui`, `go-fuzzyfinder`, and other third-party libraries against the replacement roadmap; capture outcomes in docs/architecture.md.
- Schedule a post-MVP CLI UX feedback review after each release (owners: PO + UX Expert) to collect command usability notes and feed new work into the backlog.
- No frontend architecture handoff is necessary because Lithos has no graphical UI; continue referencing this document for CLI enhancements.
