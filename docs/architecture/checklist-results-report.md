| Section | Scope                               | Result | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1       | Requirements Alignment              | Pass   | Architecture mirrors PRD epics, NFRs, and constraints exactly; frontend-only items correctly scoped out. |
| 2       | Architecture Fundamentals           | Pass   | Clear diagrams, component boundaries, and pattern rationale; no ambiguities detected.                    |
| 3       | Technical Stack & Decisions         | Pass   | All technologies pinned with justification; backup/recovery guidance added for the hybrid cache.         |
| 4       | Frontend Design & Implementation    | N/A    | Lithos is CLI-only; no UI considerations required.                                                       |
| 5       | Resilience & Operational Readiness  | Pass   | Result-based error handling, atomic writes, structured logging, and defined CI/CD pipeline.              |
| 6       | Security & Compliance               | Pass   | Local-only scope today with future hardening rules documented; secrets remain out of repo.               |
| 7       | Implementation Guidance             | Pass   | Mandatory coding/testing standards plus environment guidance keep AI work predictable.                   |
| 8       | Dependency & Integration Management | Pass   | External deps catalogued with versions; internal layering and future integrations documented.            |
| 9       | AI Agent Implementation Suitability | Pass   | Hexagonal modularity, sequence diagrams, and Result pattern support AI-driven development.               |
| 10      | Accessibility Implementation        | N/A    | No graphical UI; accessibility guidance not applicable.                                                  |

**Overall Readiness:** High. No blocking risks identified. Track long-lived dependencies (e.g., `promptui`), keep cache-regeneration guidance prominent, and consider future-proofing for remote adapters per the security section.
