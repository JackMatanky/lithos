# Testing Strategy Notes

## Unit Testing
- Test individual components in isolation
- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

## Integration Testing
- Test component interactions
- Use real fixtures when possible
- Verify end-to-end workflows

## Golden Files
- Store expected outputs for comparison
- Update golden files when behavior changes intentionally
- Use version control to track changes
